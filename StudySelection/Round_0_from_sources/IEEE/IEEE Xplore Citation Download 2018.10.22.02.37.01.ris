AB  - With the developments of communication technologies and smart manufacturing, industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged. Software-defined networking (SDN), a promising paradigm shift, has provided a viable way to manage IIoT dynamically, called software-defined industrial Internet of Things (SDIIoT). In SDIIoT, lots of data and flows are generated by industrial devices, where a physically distributed but logically centralized control plane is necessary. However, one of the most intractable problems is how to reach consensus among multiple controllers under complex industrial environments. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based consensus protocol in SDIIoT, along with detailed consensus steps and theoretical analysis, where blockchain works as a trusted third party to collect and synchronize network-wide views between different SDN controllers. Specially, it is a permissioned blockchain. In order to improve the throughput of this blockchain-based SDIIoT, we jointly consider the trust features of blockchain nodes and controllers, as well as the computational capability of the blockchain system. Accordingly, we formulate view change, access selection, and computational resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. We describe this problem as a Markov decision process by defining state space, action space, and reward function. Due to the fact that it is difficult to solve this joint problem by traditional methods, we propose a novel dueling deep Q-learning approach. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is now in its initial stage but very soon, it is going to influence almost every day-to-day items we use. The more it will be included in our lifestyle, more will be the threat of it being misused. There is an urgent need to make IoT devices secure from getting cracked. Very soon IoT is going to expand the area for the cyber-attacks on homes and businesses by transforming objects that were used to be offline into online systems. Existing security technologies are just not enough to deal with this problem. Blockchain has emerged as the possible solution for creating more secure IoT systems in the time to come. In this paper, first an overview of the blockchain technology and its implementation has been explained; then we have discussed the infrastructure of IoT which is based on Blockchain network and at last a model has been provided for the security of internet of things using blockchain.

AB  - This column evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening security in the Internet of Things (IoT). Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain-IoT security nexus are covered. From a security standpoint, the article highlights how blockchain-based solutions could be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which relies mainly on centralized cloud servers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the article argues that blockchain's decentralized nature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The column provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. Using blockchain, it is also possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. The column also discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, interorganizational networks, and industries on the frontlines of blockchain.

AB  - This paper describes the use of blockchain technology as a data provider in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Blockchain is a novel technology, which has gained a lot of attention in the last years, mainly due to its use as a backbone for cryptocurrencies. The main purpose of blockchain technology is to provide anonymous transactions between participants, over a peer-to-peer network, using a decentralized distributed ledger. The goal of this novel approach is to eliminate any 3<sup>rd</sup>party validation and replace the trust of a central authority for transaction validation with cryptographic proof. While most applications of the blockchain revolve around cryptocurrencies, the blockchain can be used in many other fields, such as finance, distributed data storage, health and medicine, automation, etc. By creating an open, decentralized network, the blockchain can be used to develop decentralized applications and enable data access and sharing on a much higher level than the common implementations of client-server architectures which are in use today. In this paper, we will present a proof of concept method for field devices to store and share data using a distributed ledger built on the IOTA tangle, as well as provide means of access to the data which can be used in IoT and decentralized applications.

AB  - The two major roadblocks for state of the art Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure like smart buildings, smart cities, etc. are lack of trust between various entities of system and single point of failure which is a vulnerability causing extreme damage to the whole system. This paper proposes a blockchain based IoT security solution where, trust is established through the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain. The distributed nature of blockchain makes the system more robust and immune to single point of failure. We propose a mechanism to establish continuous security in the system by evaluating legitimate presence of user in valid IoT-Zone continuously without user intervention. Every user interaction in an IoT environment is stored in blockchain as a transaction and series of these transactions represent a user's IoT-trail. A unique digital crypto-token is required for a user interaction to be legitimate. This token is used as an access control mechanism to prevent any unauthorized access to the system. Tokens are pre-generated using a prediction model based on user's IoT-trail in the blockchain. By using blockchain as an underlying framework in IoT environment and through the method of continuous security, we made the system more secure, robust and interoperable.

AB  - Blockchain technology and the application of smart contracts allow for automation of verifiable digital processes between any number of parties. The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen great potential in the past decade to revolutionise our day-to-day lives with the aim of automating physical processes by incorporating Internet-connected devices into commodities. By integrating the IoT with blockchain systems and smart contracts it is possible to provide verifiable automation of physical processes involving different parties. The challenge lies in that due to resource constraints, many of the computational devices used within the IoT are not capable of directly interacting with blockchain implementations. In this paper, we describe and give a reference design and implementation of a split-virtual machine, AlkylVM, which allows for resource constrained IoT devices to interact with blockchain systems.

AB  - In industrial Internet of things (IIoT), peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading ubiquitously takes place in various scenarios, e.g., microgrids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-to-grid networks. However, there are common security and privacy challenges caused by untrusted and nontransparent energy markets in these scenarios. To address the security challenges, we exploit the consortium blockchain technology to propose a secure energy trading system named energy blockchain. This energy blockchain can be widely used in general scenarios of P2P energy trading getting rid of a trusted intermediary. Besides, to reduce the transaction limitation resulted from transaction confirmation delays on the energy blockchain, we propose a credit-based payment scheme to support fast and frequent energy trading. An optimal pricing strategy using Stackelberg game for credit-based loans is also proposed. Security analysis and numerical results based on a real dataset illustrate that the proposed energy blockchain and credit-based payment scheme are secure and efficient in IIoT.

AB  - Over past two decades, the idea of Internet of Things has been adopted widely as a solution to many societal problems in different areas. These areas include but are not limited to healthcare, transportation, environment, etc. Low cost overhead of Internet connectivity feature has been the main contributing factor in the widespread use of such devices in building different IoT solutions. The original stovepipe architecture of IoT systems limits the possibility of sharing the hardware infrastructure of IoT solutions and therefore is the main barrier against novel solutions. In recent year, however, there have been efforts to come up with solutions for sharing the hardware infrastructure and therefore pave the way for innovative solutions by amortizing the capital cost of setting up the hardware. In this work, we propose an architectural guideline for blockchain enabled IoT devices which facilitates sharing them between multiple blockchain ecosystems and at the same time, ensures the exclusive access to them seamlessly through blockchain smart contracts.

Sending this type of data to centralized companies represents a serious risk for people's privacy, since economical or political interests could lead to an illegitimate use of personal information (as shown by Snowden's revelations). With the purpose of overcoming such status-quo, our research goal is to develop software systems according to the notion of decentralized private-by-design IoT. The basic idea is that data produced by personal IoT devices are safely stored in a distributed system whose design guarantees privacy, leaving to the people-the real data owners-the decision of which of them to share and with whom. To achieve this goal, a possible solution is to leverage the use of Peer-to-Peer storage networks in combination with the blockchain. However, such architecture, despite promising, embeds still limitations, especially in terms of scalability. In this paper we discuss our research motivation, we describe our research idea applied in a possible scenario and we present the scalability problem.

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology are used to improve the traditional companies. One type of traditional companies is insurance companies. These companies suffer several problems that are leading to decrease their efficiency in modern societies. Many users of these companies are unhappy and dissatisfied because of some problems. The main problems of these companies are that their operations are not transparent. Moreover, their insurance rates are not calculated and in adaptive with customer's characteristics, e.g for low-risk and high-risk customers. Note that, users are not identical to the same insurance rates, which are determined by the insurer. In modern society, we have the IoT technology that enables us to find some specific information about users. This information enables the insurance companies to increase its accuracy. In addition, considering the potential of the smart contract of the blockchain, determining insurance rates must be transparent. This article proposes a self-organizing framework for insurance based on IoT and blockchain, which eliminates the main problems of traditional insurance. To evaluate the proposed framework, it is compared with the existing framework. The results show that it has several advantages over the existing framework and could be useful in near future.

AB  - Internet of Things and Blockchain technologies have been dominating their respective research domains for some time. IoT offers automation at the finest level in different fields, while Blockchain provides secure transaction processing for asset exchanges. The capability of IoT devices to generate transactions prompts their integration with Blockchain as the next logical step. The biggest challenges in this integration are the scalability of ledger and rate of transaction execution in Blockchain. On one hand, due to their large numbers, IoT devices will generate transactions at a rate which current block chain solutions cannot handle. On the other hand, implementing Blockchain peers onto IoT devices is impossible due to resource constraints. This prohibits direct integration of both technologies in their current state. In this article, we propose a solution to address these challenges by using a local peer network to bridge the gap. It restricts the number of transactions which enters the global Blockchain by implementing a scalable local ledger, without compromising on the peer validation of transactions at local and global level. The testbed evaluations show significant reduction in the block weight and ledger size on global peers. The solution also indirectly improves the transaction processing rate of all peers due to load distribution.

One of the technical challenges of having billions of devices deployed worldwide is the ability to manage them. Although access management technologies exist in IoT, they are based on centralized models which introduce a new variety of technical limitations to manage them globally. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for arbitrating roles and permissions in IoT. The new architecture is a fully distributed access control system for IoT based on blockchain technology. The architecture is backed by a proof of concept implementation and evaluated in realistic IoT scenarios. The results show that the blockchain technology could be used as access management technology in specific scalable IoT scenarios.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed rapidly to make our life easier. In many IoT applications (e.g., smart homes, healthcare, etc.), all the IoT devices should be synchronized in time. However, some malicious nodes located in the IoT network can influence the time synchronization, which may interrupt the IoT system and lead to serious accidents. Therefore, it is critical and challenging to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of time during the time synchronization among all the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme to assure the security during time synchronization in IoT. Specifically, a publicly verifiable ledger is utilized to record and broadcast time, which can minimize many attacks from external environments. The use of multiple time sources can avoid the vulnerabilities caused by the centralized generation of accurate time. Moreover, the decentralized structure of this scheme has the advantage of adapting the changes of network topology. By employing an improved Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, time synchronization can be implemented efficiently. At last, the analysis results show that our proposed scheme can achieve the desired security with high efficiency.

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services ad applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law. However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data security and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - already in force from 24 May 2016 - that will be applicable on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data. The IoT ecosystem is evolving quickly, developing several applications in different sectors. The main topics for the last time are Big Data and the blockchain. People are paying attention to the latest one because of its potential concrete use for services and applications, increasing the security measures to guarantee a secure system. However, it is equally important to analyse the legal issues related to them. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In this context, we cannot dismiss to guarantee an adequate protection of personal data designing any application. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection especially regarding the blockchain, focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a worldwide privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities.

AB  - Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain.

AB  - As the Internet of Things (IoT) develops and expands, management of IoT communications becomes a major challenge. A large number of IoT devices may be installed anywhere end users wish, then left unattended and be misused to attack others. In edge networks, it is difficult to properly prevent undesired communication without knowledge of the properties of an IoT service and its devices. In this paper, we argue that application service providers, developers, and network operators should 1) verify and know the authenticity of IoT services, devices, and their communications, and 2) prevent unwanted traffic from IoT devices in a trustworthy, scalable, and distributed manner. This paper proposes a Trust List that represents the distribution of trust among IoT-related stakeholders and provides autonomous enforcement of IoT traffic management at the edge networks by integrating blockchains and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The principle of Trust List is automating the process of doubting, verifying, and trusting IoT services and devices to effectively prevent attacks and abuses. The proof of concept implementation and experiment of the Trust List using both public and private blockchains reveal its good practice and suggest studies for realistic deployment.

AB  - With dramatic developments of blockchain technology, a number of blockchain-based applications emerge rapidly, among which the incorporation of blockchain into IoT is one of the most valued research direction. Such powerful incorporation is adouble-sided sword, i.e., it can benefit both individuals and society but has the vulnerability to coin hopping attack that is a new type of pool mining attack and hard to happen in traditional blockchain networks. In this paper, we theoretically prove the feasibility of coin hopping attack, deeply analyze the conditions of attack implementation, and comprehensively investigate the impacts of coin hopping attack. Moreover, some defense strategies are addressed. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work targeting coin hopping attack.

AB  - The ever-increasing number of IoT devices necessitates a secure and scalable infrastructure to store and process generated data. Blockchain is an ideal choice with its decentralized, trustless architecture. However, low-power IoT end-devices do not possess enough horsepower to run a software client for intensive blockchain calculations. The purpose of this paper is to create a proof of concept to enable low-power, resource-constrained IoT end-devices accessing a blockchain-based infrastructure. To achieve this aim, an IoT gateway is configured as a blockchain node and an event-based messaging mechanism for low-power IoT end-devices is proposed. A demonstration of such a system is realized using LoRa nodes and gateway in a private Ethereum network.

AB  - Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts-scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.

AB  - Blockchain technology is a generic term for data organization structures, cryptography algorithms, distributed consensus mechanisms, and peer-to-peer communications that are used to implement distributed ledgers. Its core value lies in the establishment of mutual trust between non-coordinated participants. However, the current blockchain applications are inclined towards software and network, missing strong connection with the real world. The Internet of Things technology connects various smart devices and sensors to Internet to facilitate recognition and management of information. This paper presents a blockchain-based Internet of Things solution, where RFID chips with built-in asymmetric encryption algorithm and scanners uploading information directly to blockchain. Compared to traditional Internet of Things designs, the proposed solution combines the advantages of both decentralized blockchain, and the Waltonchain implementation demonstrates such advantages with both data security and application flexibility.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has already reshaped and transformed our lives in many ways, ranging from how we communicate with people or manage our health to how we drive our cars and manage our homes. With the rapid development of the IoT ecosystem in a wide range of applications, IoT devices and data are going to be traded as commodities in the marketplace in the near future, similar to cloud services or physical objects. Developing such a trading platform has previously been identified as one of the key grand challenges in the integration of IoT and data science. Deployment of such a platform raises concerns about the security and privacy of data and devices since their ownership is hard to trace and manage without a central trusted authority. A central trusted authority is not a viable solution for a fully decentralized and distributed IoT ecosystem with a large number of distributed device vendors and consumers. Blockchain, as a decentralized system, removes the requirement for a trusted thirdparty by allowing participants to verify data correctness and ensure its immutability. IoT devices can use blockchain to register themselves and organize, store, and share streams of data effectively and reliably. We demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to IoT devices and data management with an aim of providing end-to-end trust for trading. We also give a brief introduction to the topics and challenges for future research toward developing a trustworthy trading platform for IoT ecosystems.

AB  - The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services and applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law. However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context it is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will be in force on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a global privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is inspired by network interconnectedness of humans, objects, and cloud services to facilitate new use cases and new business models across multiple enterprise domains including healthcare. This creates the need for continuous data streaming in IoT architectures which are mainly designed following the broadcast model. As more devices communicate with each other via the Internet, it will be crucial to determine the origins of requests and responses. Being able to store records related to the life cycle of requests and responses in an immutable form will provide documentary evidence that will help to establish transparency and accountability within the IoT. Previous works employed provenance techniques to address this problem but focus on the request perspective. However, little or nothing has been done regarding the response perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes and develops a blockchain-based provenance system to trace bi-directionally the sources of requests and responses in the IoT. This is achieved through the investigation of historical communication records. Several empirical evaluations are conducted in a real-world IoT ecosystem to prove the superiority of the proposed work.

AB  - Internet of Things, cognitive systems, and blockchain technology are three fields which have created numerous revolutions in software development. It seems that a combination among these fields may results in emerging a high potential and interesting field. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, there is no framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain. In order to study the applicability of the proposed framework, a recommender system based on the proposed framework is suggested. Since the proposed framework is novel, the suggested recommender system is novel. The suggested recommender system is compared with the existing recommender systems. The results show that the suggested recommender system has several benefits which are not available in the existing recommender systems.

This network of smart devices is expected to generate and have access to vast amounts of information, creating unique opportunities for novel applications but, at the same time raising significant privacy and security concerns that impede its further adoption and development. In this paper, we explore the potential of a blockchain-assisted information distribution system for the IoT. We identify key security requirements of such a system and we discuss how they can be satisfied using blockchains and smart contracts. Furthermore, we present a preliminary design of the system and we identify enabling technologies.

With the exponential growth of IoT devices, IoT security is becoming important. In particular, Smart Door Lock system is extremely important because it is closely related to the safety of the user. However, the data sent and received of existing Smart Door Lock system is vulnerable to forgery and hacking. To improve these security issues, we propose a Smart Door Lock system based on blockchain. Also, this provides data integrity and non-repudiation. Lastly, we propose an algorithm that the Smart Door Lock system judge some situations around itself and operates based on data sent from sensors.

AB  - Recently, the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a rapid development and significant advancement of ubiquitous applications seamlessly integrated within our daily life. Owing to the accompanying growth of the importance of privacy, a great deal of attention has focused on the issues of secure management and robust access control of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users' sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences. Furthermore, we adopt the blockchain network as the underlying architecture of data processing and maintenance to resolve privacy disputes.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in adopting BlockChain (BC), that underpins the crypto-currency Bitcoin, in Internet of Things (IoT) for security and privacy. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy. The proposed architecture uses distributed trust to reduce the block validation processing time. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications. Simulations demonstrate that our method decreases packet and processing overhead significantly compared to the BC implementation used in Bitcoin.

AB  - The rapid growth of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has brought huge challenges for large data storage, intelligent management, and information security for the entire system. The traditional centralized management approach for IoV faces the difficulty in dealing with real time response. The blockchain, as an effective technology for decentralized distributed storage and security management, has already showed great advantages in its application of Bitcoin. In this paper, we investigate how the blockchain technology could be extended to the application of vehicle networking, especially with the consideration of the distributed and secure storage of big data. We define several types of nodes such as vehicle and roadside for vehicle networks and form several sub-blockchain networks. In the paper, we present a model of the outward transmission of vehicle blockchain data, and then give detail theoretical analysis and numerical results. Our study has shown the potential to guide the application of Blockchain for future vehicle networking.

AB  - In this study, we utilize a blockchain network as the underlying communication architecture to construct an ISO/IEC 15408-2 compliant security auditing system. The proposed system is an evolutionary paradigm not only seamlessly integrating the advantages, i.e., de-centralization, robustness and tamper-resistance, of the blockchain network, but fulfilling the critical auditing requirements identified by ISO/IEC 15408-2. Versatile intelligent applications, including IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) robots, are highly suitable to adopt our security auditing system.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain (BC) is an innovative paradigm that is gaining ground in smart environments. In intelligent classrooms, IoT makes our exchange easier with the prominent advent of smart devices, connected objects and sensors. However, the important research direction in this kind of IoT-Based Ubiquitous Learning Environment (ULE) is security and privacy that remaining essential challenges. Previously, we exposed the initial architecture of ULE based on BC technology and the educational services that can be delivered via this platform. In this paper, we investigate deeper and we highlight the main component of our ULE known as integrated IoT-ubiquitous platform using BC. The collection of data exchanged across devices is determined by the miner that preserves security using transactions that trace communications. Finally, in this study we demonstrate our preliminary experimental results that show the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized platform which is more secure by analyzing confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

AB  - The phenomenal growth of Internet-services has created a vibrant new domain for sharing economy. Millions of users around the world share personal services and possessions with others - often complete strangers. Such sharing schemes also increase the risk of violation of one's informational and physical privacy. Strangers often have to trust each other with their privacy (e.g. a surveillance camera in an Airbnb room). However, very little research has been devoted to investigate privacy in sharing economy. In this paper, we explore the privacy concerns associated with contractual renting or leasing of IoT devices-enabled home. We propose a methodology to eliminate privacy threats from IoT-enabled telematics devices in a smart home via blockchain-based smart contract. For the purpose of illustration, we focus on how we can circumvent the privacy threat from indoor surveillance IP cameras in a smart home-sharing economy.

AB  - Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies are experiencing exponential growth in academia and industry. Generally, IoT is a centralized system whose security and performance mainly rely on centralized servers. Therefore, users have to trust the centralized servers; in addition, it is difficult to coordinate external computing resources to improve the performance of IoT. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide this decentralization, high credibility and high security. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT may become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based threshold IoT service system: BeeKeeper. In the BeeKeeper system, servers can process a user's data by performing homomorphic computations on the data without learning anything from them. Furthermore, any node can become a leader's server if the node and the leader desire so. In this way, BeeKeeper's performance can continually increase by attracting external computing resources to join in it. Moreover, malicious nodes can be scrutinized. In addition, BeeKeeper is fault tolerant since a user's BeeKeeper protocol may work smoothly as long as a threshold number of its servers are active and honest. Finally, we deploy BeeKeeper on the Ethereum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation. In our experiments, servers can generate their response with about 107 ms. Moreover, the performance of BeeKeeper mainly depends on the blockchain platform. For instance, the response time is about 22.5 s since the block interval of Ethereum blockchain is about 15 s. In fact, if we use some other blockchain with short block interval, the response time may be obviously short.

AB  - One of the main trends in the evolution of smart grids is transactive energy, where distributed energy resources, e.g. smart meters, develop towards Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices enabling prosumers to trade energy directly among each other, without the need of involving any centralised third party. The expected advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness would be significant, indeed technical solutions are being investigated and large-scale deployment are planned by major utilities companies. However, introducing transactive energy in the smart grid entails new security threats, such as forging energy transactions. This paper introduces an infrastructure to support reliable and cost-effective transactive energy, based on blockchain and smart contracts, where functionalities are implemented as fully decentralised applications. Energy transactions are stored in the blockchain, whose high replication level ensures stronger guarantees against tampering. Energy auctions are carried out according to transparent rules implemented as smart contracts, hence visible to all involved actors. Threats deriving from known vulnerabilities of smart meters are mitigated by temporarily keeping out exposed prosumers and updating their devices as soon as security patches become available.

AB  - To achieve privacy requirements, IoT application providers may need to spend a lot of money to replace existing IoT devices. To address this problem, this study proposes the Blockchain Connected Gateways (BC Gateways) to protect users from providing personal data to IoT devices without user consent. In addition, the gateways store user privacy preferences on IoT devices in the blockchain network. Therefore, this study can utilize the blockchain technology to resolve the disputes of privacy issues. In conclusion, this paper can contribute to improving user privacy and trust in IoT applications with legacy IoT devices.

AB  - The recent, exponential rise in adoption of the most disparate Internet of Things (IoT) devices and technologies has reached also Agriculture and Food (Agri-Food) supply chains, drumming up substantial research and innovation interest towards developing reliable, auditable and transparent traceability systems. Current IoT-based traceability and provenance systems for Agri-Food supply chains are built on top of centralized infrastructures and this leaves room for unsolved issues and major concerns, including data integrity, tampering and single points of failure. Blockchains, the distributed ledger technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, represent a new and innovative technological approach to realizing decentralized trustless systems. Indeed, the inherent properties of this digital technology provide fault-tolerance, immutability, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction records, as well as coherent digital representations of physical assets and autonomous transaction executions. This paper presents AgriBlockIoT, a fully decentralized, blockchain-based traceability solution for Agri-Food supply chain management, able to seamless integrate IoT devices producing and consuming digital data along the chain. To effectively assess AgriBlockIoT, first, we defined a classical use-case within the given vertical domain, namely from-farm-to-fork. Then, we developed and deployed such use-case, achieving traceability using two different blockchain implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger Sawtooth. Finally, we evaluated and compared the performance of both the deployments, in terms of latency, CPU, and network usage, also highlighting their main pros and cons.

AB  - Thing-to-thing payments are a key enabler in the Internet of Things (IoT) era, to ubiquitously allow for devices to pay each other for services without any human interaction. Traditional credit card-based systems are not able to handle this new paradigm, however blockchain technology is a promising payment candidate in this context. The prominent example of blockchain technology is Bitcoin, with its decentralized structure and ease of account creation. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a smart cable that connects to a smart socket and without any human interaction pays for electricity. In this paper, we identify several obstacles for the widespread use of bitcoins in thing-to-thing payments. A critical problem is the high transaction fees in the Bitcoin network when doing micro transactions. To reduce this impact, we present a single-fee micro-payment protocol that aggregates multiple smaller payments incrementally into one larger transaction needing only one transaction fee. The proof-of concept shows that trustless, autonomous, and ubiquitous thing-to-thing micro-payments is no longer a future technology.

With the proliferation of technologies such as Smart home based of Internet of Things, interconnected networks, and Blockchain, microgrid has introduced a variety of applications and innovative solutions for efficient system maintenance. This paper, in a blockchain-based smart home, it is impossible to forge data called transaction generated by using blockchain. With this unforgeable transactions, home miner that centrally processes all the transactions generated in smart home know information about energy. Based on this information, we proposes renewable energy trading platform using ethereum's smart contract to ensure secure energy trading run automatically without the third party intervention in a microgrid.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated deeply into our lives and the number of IoT devices per person is expected to increase substantially over the next few years. Due to the characteristics of IoT devices (i.e., low power and low battery), usage of these devices in critical applications requires sophisticated security measures. Researchers from academia and industry now increasingly exploit the concept of blockchains to achieve security in IoT applications. The basic idea of the blockchain is that the data generated by users or devices in the past are verified for correctness and cannot be tampered once it is updated on the blockchain. Even though the blockchain supports integrity and non-repudiation to some extent, confidentiality and privacy of the data or the devices are not preserved. The content of the data can be seen by anyone in the network for verification and mining purposes. In order to address these privacy issues, we propose a new privacy-preserving blockchain architecture for IoT applications based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques. Security, privacy, and numerical analyses are presented to validate the proposed model.

AB  - While the rapid development of IoT devices is changing our daily lives, some particular issues hinder the massive deployment of IoT devices. For example, current network ID management system cannot handle so many new terminals; there is no agreed security standards for IoT manufacturers to follow when designing their products. The whole IoT industry is expecting the breakthrough in network infrastructure and the development of novel security mechanisms that can enable the flexible, secure and reliable access and management of IoT devices. Bitcoin, first released in 2009, breeds the decentralized Blockchain technology. The decentralization, anonymity and proof of security characteristics of Blockchain can prevent collusion and single point failure of a centralized server. We believe that the application of Blockchain into the IoT system can clear the obstacles facing the development of IoT architecture and security. To this end, we propose an out-of-band two-factor authentication scheme for IoT devices based on Blockchain infrastructure. We implemented the IoT and Blockchain integrated system with Eris Blockchain and equivalent computing devices to emulate IoT devices. The overheads to run Blockchain and smart contract services on the emulator devices are measured. The BeagleBone Black and Raspberry Pi 3 nodes have an average memory usage of 29.5M, and the CPU usage of 29.55% and 13.35%, respectively.

AB  - In this paper, we propose IoTChain, a combination of the OSCAR architecture [1] and the ACE authorization framework [2] to provide an E2E solution for the secure authorized access to IoT resources. IoTChain consists of two components, an authorization blockchain based on the ACE framework and the OSCAR object security model, extended with a group key scheme. The blockchain provides a flexible and trustless way to handle authorization while OSCAR uses the public ledger to set up multicast groups for authorized clients. To evaluate the feasibility of our architecture, we have implemented the authorization blockchain on top of a private Ethereum network. We report on several experiments that assess the performance of different architecture components.

AB  - While the intersection of blockchains and the Internet of Things (IoT) have received considerable research interest lately, Nakamoto-style blockchains possess a number of qualities that make them poorly suited for many IoT scenarios. Specifically, they require high network connectivity and are power-intensive. This is a drawback in IoT environments where battery-constrained nodes form an unreliable ad hoc network such as in digital agriculture. In this paper we present Vegvisir, a partition-tolerant blockchain for use in power-constrained IoT environments with limited network connectivity. It is a permissioned, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured blockchain that can be used to create a shared, tamperproof data repository that keeps track of data provenance. We discuss the use cases, architecture, and challenges of such a blockchain.

AB  - The emergence of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm brought new opportunities in terms of service provisioning and collaboration in distributed Internet of Things environments. However, while augmenting smart devices with more autonomy, this trend deepened the privacy hole of the Internet of Things (IoT). As a mitigation, we propose in this paper a SIoT profile matching framework allowing collaboration between devices interested in the same services. The services to be included in the SIoT profile are selected by the owner of the IoT devices. The profile is then published in a privacy preserving fashion. Since trust is critical in social networks, we propose a trust model fitting with the distributed nature of IoT interactions. This trust model is based on the decentralized trustless Blockchain concept. Security analysis and performance evaluation of our scheme showed a promising tradeoff between security and efficiency.

AB  - The increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will make them targets for attacks. IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose FIF-IoT - a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. FIF-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and store them securely as transactions in a public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Hence, FIF-IoT eliminates a single entity's control over the evidence storage, avoids single-point-offailure on the storage media, and ensures high availability of evidence. FIF-IoT presents a framework that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public digital ledger. Furthermore, FIF-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and to verify the integrity of the obtained evidence. We present a case study of a forensic investigation to demonstrate that FIF-IoT is secure against evidence tampering. We also implement a prototype to evaluate the performance of FIF-IoT.

AB  - With the exponential rise in the number of devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is geared toward edge-centric computing to offer high bandwidth, low latency, and improved connectivity. In contrast, legacy cloud-centric platforms offer deteriorated bandwidth and connectivity that affect the quality of service. Edge-centric Internet of Things-based technologies, such as fog and mist computing, offer distributed and decentralized solutions to resolve the drawbacks of cloud-centric models. However, to foster distributed edge-centric models, a decentralized consensus system is necessary to incentivize all participants to share their edge resources. This paper is motivated by the shortage of comprehensive reviews on decentralized consensus systems for edge-centric Internet of Things that elucidates myriad of consensus facets, such as data structure, scalable consensus ledgers, and transaction models. Decentralized consensus systems adopt either blockchain or blockchainless directed acyclic graph technologies, which serve as immutable public ledgers for transactions. This paper scrutinizes the pros and cons of state-of-the-art decentralized consensus systems. With an extensive literature review and categorization based on existing decentralized consensus systems, we propose a thematic taxonomy. The pivotal features and characteristics associated with existing decentralized consensus systems are analyzed via a comprehensive qualitative investigation. The commonalities and variances among these systems are analyzed using key criteria derived from the presented literature. Finally, several open research issues on decentralized consensus for edge-centric IoT are presented, which should be highlighted regarding centralization risk and deficiencies in blockchain/blockchainless solutions.

The question that emerges is how we can trust the constrained infrastructure that shortly is expected to be formed by millions of 'things.' The answer is not to trust. This research introduces Amatista, a blockchain-based middleware for management in IoT. Amatista presents a novel zero-trust hierarchical mining process that allows validating the infrastructure and transactions at different levels of trust. This research evaluates Amatista on Edison Arduino Boards.

AB  - The Internet of Things technology has been widely used in the quality tracking of agricultural products, however, the safety of storage for tracked data is still a serious challenge. Recently, with the expansion of blockchain technology applied in cross-industry field, the unchangeable features of its stored data provide us new vision about ensuring the storage safety for tracked data. Unfortunately, when the blockchain technology is directly applied in agricultural products tracking and data storage, it is difficult to automate storage and obtain the hash data stored in the blockchain in batches base on the identity. Addressing this issue, we propose a double-chain storage structure, and design a secured data storage scheme for tracking agricultural products based on blockchain. Specifically, the chained data structure is utilized to store the blockchain transaction hash, and together with the chain of the blockchain to form a double-chain storage, which ensures the data of agricultural products will not be maliciously tampered or destructed. Finally, in the practical application system, we verify the correctness and security of the proposed storage scheme.

AB  - Everyday number of smart devices or IOT devices either it be a smart phone, tablet, smart home device or any wearable technology are being connected to the internet. These IOT devices have become an essential part of our everyday life. We use them in many forms without being aware that we have started depending on them like for security purpose we use security systems in our house, or the smarts locks on our doors to keep our self-safe from the moon lighters. But do we really consider our security that seriously. Today IOT device security has become one of the major concern of the IT Industry. In this paper, we are using the block chain technique to develop a framework for security and management of data on the internet. We have developed a framework which shows how smart devices communicate with each other with block chain posing as the backbone. The framework serves as a scalable and robust solution, in order to address identity and security concerns of IOT. The proposed framework is further compared to existing models.

AB  - Devices to support pervasive computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming present in almost every aspect of our lives. Due to their limited power and computation, these devices often need to rely on some more powerful outsourced cloud services, which raises a security and privacy concern as IoT data is often sensitive. On the other hand, blockchain technology has recently gained much attention due to its decentralized, trustless and immutable design. We propose CapChain - an access control framework based on blockchain that allows users to share and delegate their access rights easily to IoT devices in public but still maintain privacy. To protect privacy, we adapt multiple techniques from anonymous crypto-currency blockchain systems to hide sensitive information, including users' identities and related information about the capabilities. We also build a testbed as a proof of concept.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as “miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.

Although, existing blockchain based solutions to provide data integrity verification for semi-trusted data storages (e.g. cloud providers) cannot respect the time determinism required by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Additionally, they cannot be applied to resource-constrained IoT devices. We propose an architecture that can take advantage of blockchain features to allow further integrity verification of data produced by IoT devices even in the realm of CPS. Our architecture is divided into three levels, each of them responsible for tasks compatible with their resources capabilities. The first level, composed of sensors, actuators, and gateways, introduces the concept of Proof-of-Trust (PoT), an energy-efficient, time-deterministic and secure communication based on the Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP). Upper levels are responsible for data persistence and integrity verification in the Cloud. The work also comprises a performance evaluation of the critical path of data to demonstrate that the architecture respect time-bounded operations demanded by the sense-decide-actuate cycle of CPSs. The additional delay of 5.894us added by our architecture is negligible for a typical TSTP with IEEE 802.15.4 radios which has communication latencies in the order of hundreds of milisseconds in each hop.

AB  - The majority of business activity of our integrated and connected world takes place in networks based on cloud computing infrastructure that cross national, geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. Such an efficient entity interconnection is made possible through an emerging networking paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN) that intends to vastly simplify policy enforcement and network reconfiguration in a dynamic manner. However, despite the obvious advantages this novel networking paradigm introduces, its increased attack surface compared to traditional networking deployments proved to be a thorny issue that creates skepticism when safety-critical applications are considered. Especially when SDN is used to support Internet-of-Things (IoT)-related networking elements, additional security concerns rise, due to the elevated vulnerability of such deployments to specific types of attacks and the necessity of inter-cloud communication any IoT application would require. The overall number of connected nodes makes the efficient monitoring of all entities a real challenge, that must be tackled to prevent system degradation and service outage. This position paper provides an overview of common security issues of SDN when linked to IoT clouds, describes the design principals of the recently introduced Blockchain paradigm and advocates the reasons that render Blockchain as a significant security factor for solutions where SDN and IoT are involved.

AB  - In recent times food safety has drawn upsurge of academic and commercial concerns. In supply chain area, with the rapid growth of internet technologies, a lot of emerging technologies have been applied in traceability systems. However, to date, nearly all of these systems are centralized which are monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque that could result in the trust problem, such as fraud, corruption, tampering and falsifying information. Besides, centralized system is vulnerable to collapse, since a single point of breakdown will lead the whole system to be crashed. Today, a new technology called the blockchain which is a ground-breaking innovation in decentralized information technology presents a whole new approach. However, since this technology is still in its early stages, it has some inherent defects, in which scalability become a primary and urgent one when we face the mass data in the real world. In this paper we will build a food supply chain traceability system for real-time food tracing based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), blockchain and Internet of things, which could provide an information platform for all the supply chain members with openness, transparency, neutrality, reliability and security. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept BigchainDB to fill the gap in the decentralized systems at scale. The paper concludes with a description of a use case and the challenges to adopt blockchain technology in the future food supply chain traceability systems are discussed.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in the development of various fields. The increasing scale and scope of applications make a great demand of IoT data exchange in recent years. Meanwhile, a number of IoT data exchange platforms which dedicated to connecting various and distributed data sources are emerging. In such a platform, service providers can search and exchange the data sets that they need. However, the centralized infrastructure cannot provide enough trust as the third-party intermediaries for data exchange. As a result, most platforms unable to satisfy the complex requirements due to few institutions and individuals are willing to share their IoT data sets in such an untrustworthy environment. This paper proposes a decentralized solution based on the blockchain for IoT data trusted exchange. Specifically, In this paper, the basic principles of blockchain and corresponding key technologies are expounded through in-depth analysis of three main reliable requirements in IoT data exchange. Besides, this paper provides an architecture of above solution and detailed design of its main trust component. Finally, it realizes a prototype by using Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts and presents its auditable, transparent, decentralized features visually.

AB  - Blockchain and Internet of things are the most promising and upcoming technologies. Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.

AB  - Blockchain is a technology uniquely suited to support massive number of transactions and smart contracts within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, thanks to the decentralized accounting mechanism. In a blockchain network, the states of the accounts are stored and updated by the validator nodes, interconnected in a peer-to-peer fashion. IoT devices are characterized by relatively low computing capabilities and low power consumption, as well as sporadic and low-bandwidth wireless connectivity. An IoT device connects to one or more validator nodes to observe or modify the state of the accounts. In order to interact with the most recent state of accounts, a device needs to be synchronized with the blockchain copy stored by the validator nodes. In this work, we describe general architectures and synchronization protocols that enable synchronization of the IoT endpoints to the blockchain, with different communication costs and security levels. We model and analytically characterize the traffic generated by the synchronization protocols, and also investigate the power consumption and synchronization trade-off via numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that rigorously models the role of wireless connectivity in blockchain-powered IoT systems.

AB  - The recent expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the consequent explosion in the volume of data produced by smart devices have led to the outsourcing of data to designated data centers. However, to manage these huge data stores, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage cannot afford auspicious way. There are many challenges that must be addressed in the traditional network architecture due to the rapid growth in the diversity and number of devices connected to the internet, which is not designed to provide high availability, real-time data delivery, scalability, security, resilience, and low latency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based distributed cloud architecture with a software defined networking (SDN) enable controller fog nodes at the edge of the network to meet the required design principles. The proposed model is a distributed cloud architecture based on blockchain technology, which provides low-cost, secure, and on-demand access to the most competitive computing infrastructures in an IoT network. By creating a distributed cloud infrastructure, the proposed model enables cost-effective high-performance computing. Furthermore, to bring computing resources to the edge of the IoT network and allow low latency access to large amounts of data in a secure manner, we provide a secure distributed fog node architecture that uses SDN and blockchain techniques. Fog nodes are distributed fog computing entities that allow the deployment of fog services, and are formed by multiple computing resources at the edge of the IoT network. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with the existing models using various performance measures. The results of our evaluation show that performance is improved by reducing the induced delay, reducing the response time, increasing throughput, and the ability to detect real-time attacks in the IoT network with low performance overheads.

AB  - Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in various domains, which are home, agricultural, healthcare, tourism, transportation and education. The more of its development, the more we need to consider about its security and privacy issues. In this paper, we consider smart home system (SHS) as a case study. SHS is an integration of home appliances together with sensors to get automatic operations of heating, lighting, air conditioning, home security, health care systems, etc. Moreover, SHS allows homeowner to monitor and perform appliances functions remotely at any instant time via the Internet. Due to the widespread availability and proliferation of the SHS, attackers can impersonate as a homeowner to steal important data (e.g., vital signs) for doing extortion and life threatening. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach of private Blockchain implementation for SHS to cope of its privacy and security issues. We review Ethereum Blockchain packages for SHS according to its smart contract features for handling access control policy, data storage and data flow management.

Almost every aspect of blockchain can be tailored to fit the requirements of a desired application. However, the wide range of options in configuring blockchains presents challenges in the adoption of blockchains to secure IoT. In this paper, we present the opportunities and challenges of implementing blockchains and present a use case of integrating blockchain into an IoT framework for securing sensor data acquisition.

AB  - The Internet of Things is gaining momentum thanks to the provided vision of seamlessly interconnected devices. However, a unified way to discover and to interact with the surrounding smart environment is missing. As an outcome, we have been assisting to the development of heterogeneous ecosystems, where each service provider adopts its own protocol- thus preventing IoT devices from interacting when belonging to different providers. And, the same is happening again for the blockchain technology which provides a robust and trusted way to accomplish tasks -unfortunately not providing interoperability thus creating the same heterogeneous ecosystems above highlighted. In this context, the fundamental research question we address is how do we find things or services in the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose the first IoT discovery approach which provides an answer to the above question by exploiting hierarchical and universal multi-layered blockchains. Our approach does neither define new standards nor force service providers to change their own protocol. On the contrary, it leverages the existing and publicly available information obtained from each single blockchain to have a better knowledge of the surrounding environment. The proposed approach is detailed and discussed with the support of relevant use cases.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect not only computers and mobile devices, but it will also interconnect smart buildings, houses, and cities, as well as electrical grids, gas plants, and water networks, automobiles, airplanes, etc. IoT will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that are pervasive, cost-effective, and can be accessed from anywhere and at any time. However, due to the exponential number of interconnected devices, cyber-security in the IoT is a major challenge. It heavily relies on the digital identity concept to build security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. Current centralized identity management systems are built around third party identity providers, which raise privacy concerns and present a single point of failure. In addition, IoT unconventional characteristics such as scalability, heterogeneity and mobility require new identity management systems to operate in distributed and trustless environments, and uniquely identify a particular device based on its intrinsic digital properties and its relation to its human owner. In order to deal with these challenges, we present a Blockchain-based Identity Framework for IoT (BIFIT). We show how to apply our BIFIT to IoT smart homes to achieve identity self-management by end users. In the context of smart home, the framework autonomously extracts appliances signatures and creates blockchain-based identifies for their appliance owners. It also correlates appliances signatures (low level identities) and owners identifies in order to use them in authentication credentials and to make sure that any IoT entity is behaving normally.

AB  - This paper introduces some trust issues for blockchain transactions. Such transactions rely on ECDSA signature based on 32 bytes secret keys. Because these keys can be stolen or hacked, we suggest to prevent these risks by using javacard secure elements. We detailed the interface of a Crypto Currency Smart Card (CCSC) designed over a JC3.04 standard platform. We details two use cases. First deals with deployment of the CCSC application in low cost low power object powered by an open hardware (arduino) platform, and integrates sensor data in ethereum transactions. Second proposes the deployment in the cloud of CCSC javacards plugged to RACS servers, in order to enable the remote and safe use of ECDSA signature.

AB  - Our personal data is now more valuable than ever. The uncontrolled growth of internet-centered services has led us to accept many compromises about how we share it. In the era of Internet of Things, personal data is collected continuously. Now, more than ever, we are in need of privacy-preserving applications where users always retain control of their personal data. In this paper, we present a secure way to control the flow of personal data in the specific case of the recruitment of participants for clinical trials. We take special care to protect the interests of both parties: the individual can keep its data private until an agreement is reached, and the Clinical Research Institute can be assured that it is acquiring useful and authentic data. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and study its performance based on a real-world evaluation.

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the block-chain and, in general, Peer-to-Peer approaches could play an important role in the development of decentralized and data-intensive applications running on billion of devices, preserving the privacy of the users. Our research goal is to understand whether the blockchain and Peer-to-Peer approaches can be employed to foster a decentralized and private-by-design IoT. As a first step in our research process, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review on the blockchain to gather knowledge on the current uses of this technology and to document its current degree of integrity, anonymity and adaptability. We found 18 use cases of blockchain in the literature. Four of these use cases are explicitly designed for IoT. We also found some use cases that are designed for a private-by-design data management. We also found several issues in the integrity, anonymity and adaptability. Regarding anonymity, we found that in the blockchain only pseudonymity is guaranteed. Regarding adaptability and integrity, we discovered that the integrity of the blockchain largely depends on the high difficulty of the Proof-of-Work and on the large number of honest miners, but at the same time a difficult Proof-of-Work limits the adaptability. We documented and categorized the current uses of the blockchain, and provided a few recommendations for future work to address the above-mentioned issues.

AB  - In a world deploying an Internet of Things, sensors and actuators are owned, accessed, and activated by a plethora of individuals and organizations. Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of "things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we "acquire" and "distribute" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions. The scheme puts users (including organizational entities) in the center of control over the access to their collections of sensory data. In our paper, we describe a deployment of these ideas for health care, smart cities, and autonomous cars.

AB  - The rise of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) indicates that AVs are soon going to be the juggernaut in car industry. The state-of-the-art technology used by the AVs makes ride-sharing a prominent and flexible way for transportation. In this case, the customers (i.e., who are sharing the AV) and the AV all should come into the picture to verify each other. However, When a user requests for a ride share or rent, the responding AV/IoT device does not have the sufficient capability to store, process, or verify each other. In the existing security solutions, every AV/IoT device typically needs to rely on a trusted third party, which invokes another trust issue. If the trusted third party is rogue or loses credibility, the whole system will collapse. This research aims at exploiting Blockchain to provide a secure and reliable way to communicate among devices with trusts. We implement our proposed Blockchain-based solution and demonstrate the solution on a synthetic case study.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) network of connected devices currently contains more than 11 billion devices and is estimated to double in size within the next four years. The prevalence of these devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To reduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches) for their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless and decentralized blockchainbased network in which nodes can host and deliver security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network. However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space, bandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes (referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the need for trust between the security update distributor and the security consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.

AB  - The development of robotics, the Internet of Things concept, big data processing techniques, automation, and distributed digital ledgers leads to the fourth industrial revolution. One of the main issues of new industry is interaction between the "smart factory" components both internally and with other factories based on the Internet of Things. This interaction should provide trust between the participants of the Internet of Things; control over the distribution of resources (such as maintenance time, energy, etc.) and finished products. The paper describes one of the possible ways of integrating Internet of Things and blockchain technologies to solve these issues. For this purpose, an architecture has been developed that combines Smart-M3 information sharing platform and blockchain platform. One of the main features of the proposed architecture is the use of smart contracts for processing and storing information related to the interaction between smart space components.

AB  - Data assurance and resilience are crucial security issues in cloud-based IoT applications. With the widespread adoption of drones in IoT scenarios such as warfare, agriculture and delivery, effective solutions to protect data integrity and communications between drones and the control system have been in urgent demand to prevent potential vulnerabilities that may cause heavy losses. To secure drone communication during data collection and transmission, as well as preserve the integrity of collected data, we propose a distributed solution by utilizing blockchain technology along with the traditional cloud server. Instead of registering the drone itself to the blockchain, we anchor the hashed data records collected from drones to the blockchain network and generate a blockchain receipt for each data record stored in the cloud, reducing the burden of moving drones with the limit of battery and process capability while gaining enhanced security guarantee of the data. This paper presents the idea of securing drone data collection and communication in combination with a public blockchain for provisioning data integrity and cloud auditing. The evaluation shows that our system is a reliable and distributed system for drone data assurance and resilience with acceptable overhead and scalability for a large number of drones.

AB  - The Intelligent vehicle is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from a lot of security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable of providing secure IV, mainly in terms of communication. In IV communication, major issues are trust and data accuracy of received and broadcasted reliable data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin which has been recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IV Communication world. IV to IV, communicate in a decentralized manner within communication networks. In this paper, we have proposed, Trust Bit (TB) for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. Our proposed trust bit provides surety for each IVs broadcasted data, to be secure and reliable in every particular networks. Our Trust Bit is a symbol of trustworthiness of vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal also includes a reward system, which can exchange some TB among IVs, during successful communication. For the data management of this trust bit, we have used blockchain technology in the vehicular cloud, which can store all Trust bit details and can be accessed by IV anywhere and anytime. Our proposal provides secure and reliable information. We evaluate our proposal with the help of IV communication on intersection use case which analyzes a variety of trustworthiness between IVs during communication.

AB  - With the successful deployment of wireless networks such as cellular and Wi-Fi networks as well as development of lightweight hand-held devices, wireless communication became the fastest growing sector in communication industry and wireless networks have been part of every business. Over 25 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Because of exponentially increasing number of connected devices, we have Internet of Things (IoT) enabled applications that offer socioeconomic benefits. Different IoT applications have different operational requirements and constraints. For instance, IoT enabled transportation cyber-physical system needs lowest latency and high data rate, IoT enabled financial systems or banks need high security to support mobile banking, IoT enabled manufacturing systems need high resiliency to combat fault tolerance and cyber-attacks, IoT enabled cyber-physical power system needs the least latency and highest resiliency to avoid power outage caused by faults or cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose wireless network virtualization to create different virtual wireless networks (VWNs) through mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to support different IoT enabled systems with diverse requirements and resiliency. Wireless virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization, provide better coverage, increase network capacity, enhance energy efficiency and provide security. In order to prevent double-spending (allocating same frequency to multiple network providers) of wireless resources, we have proposed to use blockchain based approach which provides quality-of-service to users. Furthermore, IoT is expected to generate massive amount of data (aka big data), we consider edge computing to process big data when individual devices have limited computing/processing and storage capabilities. Moreover, network segmentation through VWNs provides the security and enhances the network performance. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained from simulation.

AB  - Ubiquitous learning environments have an increasing trend considering the huge number of connected smart devices dedicated to educational services. Ubiquitous learning (U-learning) provides to students the possibility to learn at anyplace and anytime within the collaborative environment using interactive multimedia system that enables effective communication among teacher and learners. The architecture of ubiquitous learning environment (ULE) still suffers from the problems of vulnerability. Blockchain (BC) technology recently explored to provide much more privacy and security using essentially peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has a significant role in the development of decentralized topologies. This paper expounds a novel BC-based architecture for ULE that preserves the benefits of security and privacy. The architecture offers new opportunities to design secured collaborative learning system. It provides data exchange with BC using trust methods within the decentralized topology. The evaluation of this implemented system demonstrates its efficiency while it delivers security and privacy for ULE.

AB  - This paper investigates a critical access control issue in the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, we propose a smart contract-based framework, which consists of multiple access control contracts (ACCs), one judge contract (JC) and one register contract (RC), to achieve distributed and trustworthy access control for IoT systems. Each ACC provides one access control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract platform to achieve the access control.

AB  - Digital world has produced efficiencies, new innovative products, and close customer relationships globally by the effective use of mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), social media, analytics and cloud technology to generate models for better decisions. Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.

AB  - It is a challenge to ensure data integrity for cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications because of the inherently dynamic nature of IoT data. The available frameworks of data integrity verification with public auditability cannot avoid the Third Party Auditors (TPAs). However, in a dynamic environment, such as the IoT, the reliability of the TPA-based frameworks is far from being satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for Data Integrity Service. Under such framework, a more reliable data integrity verification can be provided for both the Data Owners and the Data Consumers, without relying on any Third Party Auditor (TPA). In this paper, the relevant protocols and a subsequent prototype system, which is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals, are presented. The performance evaluation of the implemented prototype system is conducted, and the test results are discussed. The work lays a foundation for our future work on dynamic data integrity verification in a fully decentralized environment.

AB  - In a Smart City scenario, the authors envisioned an IoT-Cloud framework for the management of boards and resources scattered over a geographic area. It can also become a tool to let device owners contribute freely to the infrastructure. In comparison to datacenter-oriented Cloud middleware, the administrator and the owner of the infrastructure are not one and the same. This translates into the requirement to support delegation-enabled authorization. In this paper, the authors investigate an authorization and delegation model for the IoT-Cloud based on blockchain technology. In particular, the scheme is implemented in the form of smart contracts over the Ethereum platform. Indeed, this approach represents an enhancement, over a function previously designed in a centralized fashion, by enabling the user to audit authorization operations and inspect how access control is actually performed, without blindly trusting the Cloud as a proxy for access to resources.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has been experiencing exponential growth in recent years, but still faces many serious challenges. The distributed ledger technology (DLT), e.g., Blockchain, not only appears to be promising to address these technical challenges, but also brings tremendous opportunities for new application and business models. However, the convergence of IoT and DLT is yet a goal far beyond our reach today. Among many problems that have not been sufficiently understood, a fundamental one is how to design appropriate consensus mechanisms for DLT applied to IoT, which is the theme of this paper. We first discuss the potential benefits of applying DLT to IoT, and identify major challenges posed to DLT by IoT. Then we make a survey of existing DLT consensus mechanisms, to summarize major principles and discuss their pros and cons when applied in IoT.

AB  - The IoT presents opportunities in all industrial sectors and is integral to the future of goods and services. The IoT includes the old Internet, but is substantially different from the old Internet for at least one very simple reason: the devices at the periphery of the network are not operated by people. These devices may be semi-or fully automated. And they will vastly outnumber the human operated devices in a short period of time. Blockchain is the basis technology for crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. But Blockchain can have far larger applications in the IoT, because Blockchain is highly distributed and publically viewable system of sequentially linked cryptographically. This in turn means that the Blockchain can be used to build trusted connections without an intermediary. This paper presents a concept of application.

AB  - With the advancements in Internet technologies and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), a new era of the Internet of Things (IoT) is being realized. IoT produces a lot of information which can be used to improve the efficiency of our daily lives and provides advanced services in a wide range of application domains. However, the privacy and the data fusing problems remain major challenges, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks and the amount of data collected from IoT increasing at an exponential rate. Thus, a privacy-protected and inter-cloud data fusing platform is needed to the demand for data mining and analytic activities in IoT. In this paper, we propose such a platform based on JointCloud Blockchain and study a novel case of smart traveling based on the proposed platform.

AB  - Building the Internet of Things requires deploying a huge number of objects with full or limited connectivity to the Internet. Given that these objects are exposed to attackers and generally not secured-by-design, it is essential to be able to update them, to patch their vulnerabilities and to prevent hackers from enrolling them into botnets. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties, i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability. In this work, we investigate how the use of a blockchain infrastructure can meet these requirements, with a focus on availability. In addition, we propose a peer-to-peer mechanism, to spread updates between objects that have limited access to the Internet. Finally, we give an overview of our ongoing prototype implementation.

AB  - Due to the centralization of authority in the management of data generated by IoT devices, there is a lack of transparency in how user data is being shared among third party entities. With the popularity of adoption of blockchain technology, which provide decentralized management of assets such as currency as seen in Bitcoin, we propose a decentralized system of data management for IoT devices where all data access permission is en-forced using smart contracts and the audit trail of data access is stored in the blockchain. With smart contracts applications, multiple parties can specify rules to govern their interactions which is independently enforced in the blockchain without the need for a centralized system. We provide a framework that store the hash of the data in the blockchain and store the raw data in a secure storage platform using trusted execution environment (TEE). In particular, we consider Intel SGX as a part of TEE that ensure data security and privacy for sensitive part of the application (code and data).

This paper aims to investigate whether the consensus process using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) could be a performance bottleneck for networks with a large number of peers. We model the PBFT consensus process using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN) to compute the mean time to complete consensus for networks up to 100 peers. We create a blockchain network using IBM Bluemix service, running a production-grade IoT application and use the data to parameterize and validate our models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis over a variety of system parameters and examine the performance of larger networks.

AB  - This paper introduces some of the interdependent components within the multifaceted solution our team is developing towards accelerating the functionality, complexity and versatility of blockchain-enabled services. The focus here is particularly on introducing and bringing together selected individual components of the solution to achieve a synergistic effect in expanding the functionality of blockchain-enforced smart contracts. The contributions of this paper include: (i) proposing a method for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) proposing a method for efficient and secure matching and transfer of smart-contract underlyings (entities) among disparate smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) proposing a method for producing an hierarchy of common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased security, and applying this method both in the context of method (i) and method (ii); and (iv) proposing the use of distributed hash tables DHT in building secure and optimized repositories in the context of method (i) and in the context method (ii), where the former involves a DHT repository of smart contracts and the latter involves a DHT repository of entities underlying smart contracts that are being exchanged among different smart contracts and subcontracts. The smart-contract focused methods introduced in this paper contribute to the overall goal towards a sustainable adaptive mechanism for processing evolving volumes, versatility, and complexity of blockchain transactions, traffic, and services. Blockchain-enabled services are efficient, secure, automated, and allowing worldwide distribution of resources. They present a more efficient and sustainable alternative to current service infrastructures within a range of domains, particularly the legal and financial domains. They also set a sustainable infrastructure for emerging Internet-of-things services.

The implementations, which exhibit regular, constant-time execution to protect against timing and simple side-channel attacks, set new speed records and advance the state-of-the-art of curve-based (without endomorphism) scalar multiplication on 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM11 microcontrollers. For example, our NUMS256 implementation computes a scalar multiplication in ~1.4 million cycles on a low-power 32-bit ARM11 microcontroller using mixed C and assembly language. These results demonstrate the potential of deploying IoT-NUMS on constrained and low-power applications such as protocols for the Internet of Things.

AB  - Edge computing proposes a novel model for providing computational resources close to end devices that are connected to the network. It has numerous applications in Internet of Things, as well as smart grids, healthcare, smart home, etc. This paper presents ongoing research regarding the use of blockchain technology as a platform hierarchical and distributed control systems based on IEC 61499 standard. Hyperledger Fabric was selected as the blockchain solution, where function blocks are to be implemented as smart contracts on a supervisor level. The integration with the edge nodes that perform on the executive level responsible for actual process control is based on a micro-services architecture where Docker containers implement function blocks, and Kubernetes platform is used for orchestrating the execution of containers across the edge resources.

AB  - Current networking integrates common "Things" to the Web, creating the Internet of Things (IoT). The considerable number of heterogeneous Things that can be part of an IoT network demands an efficient management of resources. With the advent of Fog computing, some IoT management tasks can be distributed toward the edge of the constrained networks, closer to physical devices. Blockchain protocols hosted on Fog networks can handle IoT management tasks such as communication, storage, and authentication. This research goes beyond the current definition of Things and presents the Internet of "Smart Things." Smart Things are provisioned with Artificial Intelligence (AI) features based on CLIPS programming language to become self-inferenceable and self-monitorable. This work uses the permission-based blockchain protocol Multichain to communicate many Smart Things by reading and writing blocks of information. This paper evaluates Smart Things deployed on Edison Arduino boards. Also, this work evaluates Multichain hosted on a Fog network.

AB  - Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.

AB  - The H2020 European research project Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) aims to develop a cyber-security layer on IoT smart home installations. The proposed system analyses packet-level data flows for building patterns of communications between IoT devices and external entities. To ensure non-repudiation, integrity and authentication of the data captured, they are stored in a Blockchain, a distributed ledger network, as digitally-signed transactions. Since the data can potentially include sensitive user information, it is imperative to promote trust by informing users about the operating principles of the network as well as to request the acceptance of a consent form by them. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Forms of Consent application, a Distributed Application that interacts with a set of Smart Contracts deployed on a private Ethereum network. The application is being developed as part of the GHOST project.

AB  - Blockchain is a decentralized ledger used to securely exchange digital currency, perform deals and transactions. Each member of the network has access to the latest copy of encrypted ledger so that they can validate a new transaction. Blockchain ledger is a collection of all Bitcoin transactions executed in the past. Basically, it's a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing tamper proof data structure blocks which holds batches of individual transactions. The completed blocks are added in a linear and chronological order. Each block contains a timestamp and information link which points to a previous block. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer permission-less network which allows every user to connect to the network and send new transaction to verify and create new blocks. Satoshi Nakamoto described design of Bitcoin digital currency in his research paper posted to cryptography listserv in 2008. Nakamoto's suggestion has solved long pending problem of cryptographers and laid the foundation stone for digital currency. This paper explains the concept, characteristics, need of Blockchain and how Bitcoin works. It attempts to highlights role of Blockchain in shaping the future of banking, financial institutions and adoption of Internet of Things(IoT).

AB  - This paper introduces a concept of autonomous blockchain based negotiation to select the most convenient electric vehicle charging station. The enabling blockchain technologies are well known fundament of cryptocurrencies, but offer many other possible applications areas, such as automated trusted machine-to-machine transactions, including auctions, bidding and payments. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, such a solution does not require any central entities and can be fully automated, including the payment for the energy. Based on e.g. the planned route, car battery status, realtime traffic information and drivers' preferences, a car could request charging bids from various charging stations along the route, by executing blockchain based smart contracts related to these charging stations. It would then select the most appropriate one based on offered prices, but other input parameters could be also taken into account, e.g. waiting times, estimated charging duration and alike. The smart contract execution could be extended to reservation and payment, too. In the paper we briefly present blockchain technologies, with the focus on Ethereum, and explain the role of smart contracts. We outline the architecture of a simple system for autonomous selection for electric vehicle charging station and provide a UML model to depict the activities of the actors involved in these operations and to clarify the role and the requirements of various blockchain related entities. The aim of our research paper is to outline a possible use-case for a blockchain prototype implementation. The implementation, which is not presented here, will serve for investigation of practical aspects of smart node development and operation, like transaction performance measurements, practical system requirement evaluations and comparison of reliability of various Ethereum clients. By our research we hope to support the investigation of novel applications and blending Internet of things with blockchain technologies, and in particular for elaboration of possible new use cases in the domain of electrical energy and mobility.

AB  - Blockchain is a new trend rising fast from the community and the enterprise world. As an infrastructural technology it is finding its way into a growing number of domains like finance, medical, digital marketplace, pharmaceutical and government agencies. While blockchain technology is primarily thought as the foundation of Bitcoin, it has grown far beyond underpinning the virtual currency. It promises building better trust, transparency, and integrity without a third-party and the risk of censorship. These remarkable advantages do however come at a price. The blockchain ecosystem is riddled with human-centric and economical issues for its participants, leading to unintended consequences in decentralized networks. Gamified software engineering is a growing field that in particular taps into gamification technology, the application of game mechanics in non-game contexts, to address human-related concerns. There are currently no studies around blockchain that have been identified to have a clear view of existing research and solutions for utilizing the gamification in the emerging blockchain systems. As a first step towards filling this gap, this paper discusses and identifies two major human-based problems in the blockchain decentralized applications and development. For those problems, it proposes a preliminary gamified model to provide a basis for expanding future research and applications in this joint domain.

AB  - Public blockchain networks using proof of work-based consensus protocols are considered a promising platform for decentralized resource management with financial incentive mechanisms. In order to maintain a secured, universal state of the blockchain, proof of work-based consensus protocols financially incentivize the nodes in the network to compete for the privilege of block generation through cryptographic puzzle solving. For rational consensus nodes, i.e., miners with limited local computational resources, offloading the computation load for proof of work to the cloud/fog providers becomes a viable option. In this paper, we study the interaction between the cloud/fog providers and the miners in a proof of work-based blockchain network using a game theoretic approach. In particular, we propose a lightweight infrastructure of the proof of work-based blockchains, where the computation-intensive part of the consensus process is offloaded to the cloud/fog. We formulate the computation resource management in the blockchain consensus process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the profit of the cloud/fog provider and the utilities of the individual miners are jointly optimized. In the first stage of the game, the cloud/fog provider sets the price of offered computing resource. In the second stage, the miners decide on the amount of service to purchase accordingly. We apply backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibria in each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For uniform pricing where the same price applies to all miners, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is validated by identifying the best response strategies of the miners. For discriminatory pricing where the different prices are applied, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved by capitalizing on the variational inequality theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our proposed model.

AB  - Credible reputation lies at the core of users and devices communicating and transacting successfully. Identity fraud is becoming increasingly difficult to manage in the face of massive-scale database breaches. In critical infrastructure and public safety applications, as well as day-to-day personal and business transactions, it is imperative to have a significant degree of confidence in whom/what one communicates with - whether to know if the recipient can be entrusted with the sender's data, or if the sender's data is to be considered reliably sourced. Even where possible, lost reputation is substantially more cumbersome, timeconsuming and expensive to replace than are compromised, stolen or defective devices and their embedded cryptographic keys. This paper focuses on two methodologies that have considerable implications relative to addressing the reputation issue: (1) blockchain-enabled anomaly detection and assessment that involves dynamically asserted identity at the network edge effected through end-user targeted release of trusted behavioral data; (2) IoT and human interaction that is securely facilitated through use of an "Inviter-Invitee" protocol to set up dedicated maintainable "communication lines." The judiciously applied combination of the cryptographic protocol suites that enable the two methodologies results in a practicably implementable system for smart city use cases.

AB  - As a recently proposed public key primitive, attribute-base encryption(ABE) divided into Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) and Key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) is a highly promising tool for the management and protection of data. And Blockchain, as one of the core technologies of Bitcoin that is the most representative cryptocurrency, has received extensive attentions recently. Supervision and privacy protection are two difficulties in blockchain. In this paper, a new scheme combining blockchain and accountable CP-ABE is proposed. In this scheme, each change of the data is recorded on the blockchain. And the different permissions of access are realized through ABE. If a malicious user shares a decryption key illegally, it will be considered illegal. Similarly, if the authority generates a decryption key for any unauthorized user, it also will be considered illegal. This scheme allows any third party to publicly verify the identity of a decryption key. And it is achievable for an auditor to publicly audit whether a malicious user or the authority should be responsible for an exposed decryption key, and the key abuser cannot deny it. At last this scheme is applied to the management of electronic documents.

AB  - Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) interconnects thousands of terminal devices to support the services of Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G area. However, centralized access authentication of each terminal has been performed in mobile core network which causes an extremely high operating and capital expenditure of network. Traditional C-RAN cannot provide an authentic mechanism to guarantee the security of services and creditability of device and resource accessing with low network cost. We first propose a blockchain-based trusted authentication (BTA) architecture for 5G with blockchain-based anonymous access (BAA) scheme in cloud radio over fiber network. The feasibility and efficiency are verified on enhanced SDN testbed to enable blockchain as a service.

AB  - As modern vehicle and communication technologies advanced apace, people begin to believe that the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) would be achievable in one decade. ITS introduces information technology to the transportation infrastructures and aims to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, security is still a main concern in vehicular communication systems (VCSs). This can be addressed through secured group broadcast. Therefore, secure key management schemes are considered as a critical technique for network security. In this paper, we propose a framework for providing secure key management within the heterogeneous network. The security managers (SMs) play a key role in the framework by capturing the vehicle departure information, encapsulating block to transport keys and then executing rekeying to vehicles within the same security domain. The first part of this framework is a novel network topology based on a decentralized blockchain structure. The blockchain concept is proposed to simplify the distributed key management in heterogeneous VCS domains. The second part of the framework uses the dynamic transaction collection period to further reduce the key transfer time during vehicles handover. Extensive simulations and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, in which the blockchain structure performs better in term of key transfer time than the structure with a central manager, while the dynamic scheme allows SMs to flexibly fit various traffic levels.

AB  - The drastically increasing volume and the growing trend on the types of data have brought in the possibility of realizing advanced applications such as enhanced driving safety, and have enriched existing vehicular services through data sharing among vehicles and data analysis. Due to limited resource of vehicles, mobile edge computing integrated with vehicular networks gives rise to Vehicular Edge COmputing and Networks (VECONs) for providing powerful computing and massive storage resources. However, vehicular edge computing servers consisted of roadside units cannot be fully trusted, which may result in serious security and privacy challenges. We exploit consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies to achieve secure data storage and sharing in vehicular edge networks. These technologies efficiently prevent data sharing without authorization. In addition, we propose a reputation based data sharing scheme to ensure high-quality data sharing among vehicles. A three-weight subjective logic model is utilized for precisely managing reputation of the vehicles. Numerical results based on a real dataset show that our schemes achieve reasonable efficiency and high-level security for data sharing in VECONs.

AB  - In recent years, volunteer service in China has made an unprecedented development, but the credibility and traceability of volunteer service time management are confronted with serious challenges. Since traditional time record systems cannot protect the related data security of the volunteers. In this paper, we study the volunteer time record system based on the blockchain technology which is the core technology of bitcoin, unlike bitcoin transaction in our system are not strictly financial - they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying, and sharing data. Volunteer service time and activity information recorded by sending the chain transaction. Effective time recognition is guaranteed by smart contract. It can ensure that the volunteer's time is independent of improper human interference, and the fairness of volunteer service, realizes the traceability and transparency of the entire time record process. Then we describe a specific case and use the system we proposed storing the volunteer service time, volunteers' service time can be certified effectively.

However, the means to exchange this leftover currency, coins in particular, is largely inconvenient often leading to considerable amounts discarded or left unused. In this paper, we explore how distributed ledger technology, i.e. blockchain, could be applied to the problem of utilizing this leftover foreign currency. We portray here the drawbacks of the existing systems of foreign currency exchange and delineate the requirements of a potential mobile web application for exchanging this currency by integrating smart kiosk based systems, particularly for handling cash, with a peer-to-peer currency exchange technique based on blockchain that could help to bring such currency back into circulation efficiently.

AB  - The evidence has three properties including relevance, authenticity and legitimacy. For evidence, once implemented, it must not be tampered with and can always be traced back. For trust, the content can be forensics, so the relationship between each other is trustworthy and exchangeable value. Blockchain is a tamper-proof and unforgeable decentralized shared ledger that chunks data blocks chronologically into specific data structures and is cryptographically guaranteed. In this paper, we use the key technologies of blockchain to investigate and achieve collaborative security for IoT devices. This approach uses distributed crowd-sourcing to make tampering of critical data evidence (security). Combination of theoretical research and empirical validation, the paper tries to provide a technical operational and cost-effective solution for collaborative security with blockchain services and promoting the key data stability and self-healing ability.

These concerns hinder the wide adoption of the IoT. To overcome them, in this work, we present an Blockchain-based architecture for IoT access authorizations. Following the IoT tendency requirements, our architecture is user transparent, user friendly, fully decentralized, scalable, fault tolerant and compatible with a wide range of today's access control models used in the IoT. Finally, our architecture also has a secure way to establish relationships between users, devices and group of both, allowing the assignment of attributes for these relationships and their use in the access control authorization.

In this paper, we propose a punishment scheme based on the action record on the blockchain to suppress the attack motivation of the edge servers and the mobile devices in the edge network. The interactions between a mobile device and an edge server are formulated as a blockchain security game, in which the mobile device sends a request to the server to obtain real-time service or launches attacks against the server for illegal security gains, and the server chooses to perform the request from the device or attack it. The Nash equilibria (NEs) of the game are derived and the conditions that each NE exists are provided to disclose how the punishment scheme impacts the adversary behaviors of the mobile device and the edge server.

AB  - Due to increased number of attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the security of IoT networks became critical. Some recent researches proposed the adoption of blockchain in IoT networks without a thorough discussion on the impact of the solution on the devices performance. Furthermore, blockchain employment in the context of IoT can be challenging due to the devices hardware limitations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an IoT ledger-based architecture to ensure access control on heterogeneous scenarios. This research applies conventional devices used on IoT networks, such as Arduino, Raspberry and Orange Pi boards. Finally, we perform performance evaluation focused on access control of IoT devices and on information propagation through peers on a private IoT network scenario.

AB  - Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based sensor networks have gained unprecedented popularity in recent years and they become crucial for supporting high data rate real-time applications. For efficient data transmission within IoT networks, it is necessary that each IoT node learns and adapts itself to recent time/spectral characteristics of channels to maximize the throughput and perform channel swapping wherever required. Many researchers have proposed channel allocation and channel quality measurement protocols within multichannel sensor networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature available that proposes an automated and adaptive protocol that can learn and adapt according to changing channel characteristics in IoT network for achieving maximum data transmission and throughput. Therefore, this paper proposes a fully automated self-learning and adaptive protocol which can automatically transmit multiuser data by efficiently utilizing channel time/spectral characteristics. The proposed protocol is unique as it learns and adapts itself to the increasing network density based upon the network metrics. It also allows each node within IoT network to automatically detect the neighboring channel attributes so that they can swap channels to achieve maximum data transfer. This is accomplished by continuously extracting distinct features from the network topology. After extracting these features, the proposed protocol efficiently selects the best channel for an incoming node, provides the best channel utilization based upon its time/spectral attributes, and detects and allocates the unused spectrum of neighboring channels through multistage Gaussian radial basis function and multilayer perceptron-based nonlinear support vector machines classification model. Simulation results demonstrate the supremacy of the proposed protocol in terms of throughput, successful reporting probability, average blocking probability, fairness, and classification accuracy.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoTs) offers a plethora of opportunities for remote monitoring and communication of everyday objects known as things with applications in numerous domains. The advent of blockchains can be a significant enabler for IoTs towards conducting and verifying transactions in a secure manner. However, applying blockchains to IoTs is challenging due to the resource constrained nature of the embedded devices coupled with significant delay incurred in processing and verifying transactions in the blockchain. Thus there exists a need for profiling the energy consumption of blockchains for securing IoTs and analyzing energy-performance trade-offs. Towards this goal, we profile the impact of workloads based on Smart Contracts and further quantify the power consumed by different operations performed by the devices on the Ethereum platform. In contrast to existing approaches that are focused on performance, we characterize performance and energy consumption for real workloads and analyse energy-performance trade-offs. Our proposed methodology is generic in that it can be applied to other platforms. The insights obtained from the study can be used to develop secure protocols for IoTs using blockchains.

AB  - With the dramatically increasing deployment of IoT devices, storing and protecting the large volume of IoT data has become a significant issue. Traditional cloud-based IoT structures impose extremely high computation and storage demands on the cloud servers. Meanwhile, the strong dependencies on the centralized servers bring significant trust issues. To mitigate these problems, we propose a distributed data storage scheme employing blockchain and cetrificateless cryptography. Our scheme eliminates the traditional centralized servers by leveraging the blockchain miners who perform "transaction" verifications and records audit with the help of certificateless cryptography. We present a clear definition of the transactions in a non-cryptocurrency system and illustrate how the transactions are processed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work designing a secure and accountable IoT storage system using blockchain. Additionally, we extend our scheme to enable data trading and elaborate how data trading can be efficiently and effectively achieved.

AB  - The European research project GHOST challenges the traditional cyber security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by exploiting novel technologies, such as blockchain, to provide resilience and integrity of decision making on the communication exchange in a smart home context. When it comes to novel cyber security solutions for extremely heterogeneous environments like IoT and smart homes, the key focus is typically given to the understanding of network activities and elimination of suspicious traffic. The GHOST project adds an extra dimension to this approach by integrating blockchain technology at its core decision mechanism. On a daily basis, each GHOST installation is encountering malicious behaviour and suspicious IoT communications, where easy information sharing with other installations, as well as decentralised decision making, are mandatory features for the efficient protection of the end-user. GHOST's Smart Contracts (SC) are designed to tackle in an easy, yet productive way, the reporting on suspicious IP addresses which the IoT devices in a smart home are trying to communicate with. Two variations of blacklisting smart contracts are presented in this paper, covering a diverse spectrum of possible attack vectors while closely following the Privacy by Design (PbD) principles. A reputation scoring scheme for malicious IPs reporting is integrated in the SC, uncovering the implementation details on the penalisation of existing entries in case of malicious behaviour of reporting devices.

AB  - Wireless network virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization to support exponentially increasing demand caused by emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To create virtual wireless networks (VWNs), there are no automated secure approaches for allocating RF spectrum to meet the dynamically changing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. In wireless networks, RF spectrum is shared among many users and the given RF spectrum could be easily overcrowded because of the over commitment of limited resources by the service providers. There is a direct incentive in terms of revenue to service providers to have more number of users. In this paper, we propose to leverage a distributed Blockchain - also known as a public ledger - based scheme to create VWNs where primary wireless resource-owners (PWROs) sublease their wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) using machine-to-machine communication based on the service level agreements (SLAs) between PWROs and MVNOs. The proposed distributed Blockchain-based scheme provides security to participating PWROs and MVNOs as well as prevents PWROs from over committing their resources (that stops double spending) and helps MVNOs to meet the QoS requirements of their users. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or similar regulatory bodies in other countries participate in this framework by providing the guidelines and regulations about maximum power levels, licensing and geographic coverages, etc. This essentially helps users to meet their desired QoS requirements while complying the government regulations. Performance is evaluated using numerical results.

AB  - Internet of Things becomes a major part of our lives, billions of autonomous devices are connected and communicate with each other. This revolutionary paradigm creates a new dimension that removes the boundaries between the real and the virtual worlds. The Wireless Sensor Networks are a masterpiece of the success of this technology, using limited capacity sensors and actuators, industrial, medical, agricultural and many other environments can be covered and managed automatically. This autonomous interacting things should authenticate each other, and communicate securely. Otherwise malicious users can cause serious damages on such systems. In this paper we propose a robust, transparent, flexible and energy efficient blockchain-based authentication mechanism called BCTrust, which is designed especially for devices with computational, storage and energy consumption constraints. In order to evaluate our approach, we realized a real implementation with C programming language, and Ethereum Blockchain.

AB  - Blockchain has recently been applied in many applications such as bitcoin, smart grid, and Internet of Things (IoT) as a public ledger of transactions. However, the use of blockchain in mobile environments is still limited because the mining process consumes too much computing and energy resources on mobile devices. Edge computing offered by the Edge Computing Service Provider (ECSP) can be adopted as a viable solution for offloading the mining tasks from the mobile devices, i.e., miners, in the mobile blockchain environment. However, a mechanism for edge resource allocation to maximize the revenue for the ECSP and to ensure incentive compatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we develop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource allocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network architecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural networks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they calculate allocation and conditional payment rules for the miners. We use valuations of the miners as the training data to adjust parameters of the neural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected, negated revenue of the ECSP.We show the experimental results to confirm the benefits of using the deep learning for deriving the optimal auction for mobile blockchain with high revenue.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) interconnects thousands of sensor nodes to support the services of Internet of Things (loT). However, data collected from sensor nodes may be tempered, forged and divulged. Traditional WSN data process platform handle the data centralized in terminal devices which is vulnerable to attacks and reduce the security of the system. Blockchain is a kind of distributed databases. It has been successfully applied in finance, securities, digital currency and other fields. We first propose a blockchain-based distributed collocation storage architecture for data security process platform of WSN with consensus protocol and asymmetric signature scheme. The security and efficiency are verified on the simulation to enable blockchain as a good solution.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated services without human intervention for a wide range of applications, including continuous remote patient monitoring (RPM). However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.

AB  - The increasing trend of people moving to urban areas and the associated urbanization process require facing challenges regarding city infrastructures capability to cover citizens needs for energy, water, transportation, healthcare. education, safety. The smart urban technologies represent an important contribution to the sustainable development of cities, making smart cities a reality. The concept of Home Automation must be considered in relation to the new technologies and the new smart users and the house will no longer be regarded as a single entity, but as a fundamental part of the new concept of city. The idea of smart cities is developing extremely rapidly, integrating smart grid, services, building, house and appliances, these subsystems must be able to interact, connect, and control remotely, collaboratively, to achieve a better quality of life, sustainability, energy saving, social and economic development. The widespread of Smart City depends heavily on the capability of users to understand and handle the ICT, IoT and BC. The paper designs a smart district model that is the step necessary to build a Smart City using new technologies and the role of an efficient energy management system integrated into a platform based on an IoT and BC approach for a replicable model and can be implemented.

AB  - In the past few years, the number of wireless devices connected to the Internet has increased to a number that could reach billions in the next few years. While cloud computing is being seen as the solution to process this data, security challenges could not be addressed solely with this technology. Security problems will continue to increase with such a model, especially for private and sensitive data such as data personal and medical data collected with more and more sophisticated connected devices (forming the IoT). Thus the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems. The blockchain Technology is a promising approach giving the properties it brings to the field. This paper illustrates an architecture based on blockchain technology, and a protocol for data access, using smart contracts and a publisher-subscriber mechanism.

AB  - The security of vehicular networks has been paid increasing attention to with the rapid development of automobile industry and Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing approaches mainly focus on ensuring data authentication and integrity, which are not sufficient to assess the credibility of received messages. Recently, reputation systems are proved to be effective approaches to solve the above problem. This paper proposes a new reputation system for data credibility assessment based on the blockchain techniques. In this system, vehicles rate the received messages based on observations of traffic environments and pack these ratings into a “block”. Each block is “chained” to the previous one by storing the hash value of the previous block. Then, a temporary center node is elected from vehicles and it is responsible for broadcasting its rating block to others. Based on ratings stored in the blockchain, vehicles are able to calculate the reputation value of the message sender and then evaluate the credibility of the message. Simulation results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting, validating, and storing reputation information in vehicular networks.

AB  - Bitcoin, one major virtual currency, attracts users' attention by its novel mode in recent years. With blockchain as its basic technique, Bitcoin possesses strong security features which anonymizes user's identity to protect their private information. However, some criminals utilize Bitcoin to do several illegal activities bringing in great security threat to the society. Therefore, it is necessary to get knowledge of the current trend of Bitcoin and make effort to de-anonymize. In this paper, we put forward and realize a system to analyze Bitcoin from two aspects: blockchain data and network traffic data. We resolve the blockchain data to analyze Bitcoin from the point of Bitcoin address while simulate Bitcoin P2P protocol to evaluate Bitcoin from the point of IP address. At last, with our system, we finish analyzing its current trends and tracing its transactions by putting some statistics on Bitcoin transactions and addresses, tracing the transaction flow and de-anonymizing some Bitcoin addresses to IPs.

AB  - The U.S. power grid is a complex system of systems that requires a trustworthy, reliable, and secure global supply chain. A formidable challenge considering the increasing number of networked industrial control systems (ICS) and energy delivery systems (EDS) and growing number of intermediary distributors, vendors and integrators involved. Grid modernization has increased the use of “smart” energy devices that automate, digitize, network, and bring together the cyber-physical energy supply chain. In the current Energy Internet of Things (EIoT) environment, the growth of data speed and size requirements as well as the number of critical cyber assets has generated new North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) compliance requirements and cyber supply chain security challenges for vendors, regulators, and utilities. The issuance of Order No. 829 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) instructed the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to confront cybersecurity supply chain risk management for ICS software and hardware, as well as the networking and computing services associated with Bulk Electric System (BES) operations. To meet these goals, current technology and processes must be improved to better identify, monitor, and audit vulnerable EIoT environments. This paper examines how blockchain technology can enable NERC CIP compliance as well as aid in the security of the BES supply chain through an immutable cryptographically signed distributed ledger that allows for improved data security, provenance and auditability.

AB  - Existing data management and searching system for Internet of Things uses centralized database. For this reason, security vulnerabilities are found in this system which consists of server such as IP spoofing, single point of failure and Sybil attack. This paper proposes data management system is based on blockchain which ensures security by using ECDSA digital signature and SHA-256 hash function. Location that is indicated as IP address of data owner and data name are transcribed in block which is included in the blockchain. Furthermore, we devise data manegement and searching method through analyzing block hash value. By using security properties of blockchain such as authentication, non-repudiation and data integrity, this system has advantage of security comparing to previous data management and searching system using centralized database or P2P networks.

AB  - Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives (DIIs) are communities that collaboratively produce and consume infrastructure. To develop a healthy ecosystem, DIIs require an economic model that balances supply and demand, but there is currently a lack of tooling to support implementing these. In this research, we propose an architecture for a platform that enables DIIs to implement such models, focused around a digital currency based on blockchain technology. The currency is issued according to the amount participants contribute to the initiative, which is quantified based on operational metrics gathered from the infrastructure. Furthermore, the platform enables participants to deploy smart contracts which encode self-enforcing agreements about the infrastructure services they exchange. The architecture has been evaluated through a case study at The Things Network (TTN) a global distributed crowdsourced Internet of Things initiative. The case study revealed that the architecture is effective for the selected case at TTN. In addition, the results motivate future research lines to support scalability (i.e., to deploy the architecture on a larger scale) and security.

AB  - In recent years novel models for energy distribution appeared and islanded microgrids quest for new ways to exchange energy between consumers and producers without the need of central authorities. The blockchain mechanism has emerged as a distributed solution for recording energy transactions in power systems. The blockchain has been used to permit users bartering and selling energy and to keep track of such exchanges without exposing them to tampering. In this work, we consider a novel application of the blockchain in islanded microgrids that includes also annotating energy losses caused by energy transactions, in order to have a more realistic matching between the physical status of the energy grid and the consequent costs attributed to users. To validate our novel use of the blockchain, we carried out simulated experiments for an exemplary islanded microgrid, in which 3 main generators supply 6 load nodes. This validates the compatibility of this new cost attribution model with the supporting physical infrastructure. Preliminary results demonstrate that the superposition of energy transactions in a microgrid changes the distribution of losses in all paths, eventually due to the large reactive flows created by PV systems.

AB  - IoT is one of the leading technologies apart from blockchain that is being worked on to develop more consumer friendly devices which can help in the daily chores to perform more important and necessary actions, but as we know all the malware and security concerns which can hamper the growth of IoT based devices, we need blockchain technology to reinforce the devices as blockchain has proved it's worth as a security door which is unbreachable. The use of peer to peer communication between the IoT devices will make transactions more secure and user friendly while being fully precise. With these things in place we can see automation in household work or reduction in piracy via internet, the proper integrated use of IoT with our household devices or phones and digital devices will make our lives better and more convenient while being able to sustain more resources for the future. In current scenario, the biggest challenge is that how will Online Transactions get better and automated if we implement IoT using blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, transparency and security? In this paper we are trying to make our online transactions much more accessible and autonomous to interact whole being highly secure so as they can be integrated in the new gen smart homes systems and the home security systems, blockchain is the key to this need that we need to integrate with IoT to make our transactions more objective centered and have our payment system autonomous to make interactions with the daily services monitored by a IoT based smart device ecosystem more hassle free and fully secured. For this we will be going through the mining of blocks and their suggested applicability in the IoT ecosystem.

AB  - Remote attestation is used to enable verifiers to check if an underlying Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of a device and data from the TCB are trustworthy. However, the current remote attestation has limitations to be deployed in IoT from the perspective of the management in a massive and diverse collection of TCB measurements and the redundant execution of remote attestation. To mitigate these limitations, we present a trustworthy management of TCB measurements called TM-Coin (TCB Measurement-Coin) using the blockchain and ARM TrustZone. The TM-Coin transactions and protocol are presented to manage the TCB measurements of IoT devices using the blockchain, a decentralized database. The trusted execution environment provided by ARM TrustZone is used as the TCB to generate the TM-Coin transactions securely. Based on TM-Coin, the verifiers launch remote attestation of sensed data from the devices using the TCB measurements published in the blockchain without attesting to the TCB. We implemented a prototype to evaluate the performance overhead caused by TM-Coin.

AB  - Mobile security has become more and more important due to the boom of mobile commerce (m-commerce). However, the development of m-commerce is facing many challenges regarding data security problems. Recently, blockchain has been introduced as an effective security solution deployed successfully in many applications in practice, such as, Bitcoin, cloud computing, and Internet-of-Things. In this paper, we introduce a new m-commerce application using blockchain technology, namely, MobiChain, to secure transactions in the m-commerce. Especially, in the MobiChain application, the mining processes can be executed efficiently on mobile devices using our proposed Android core module. Through real experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model and show that blockchain will be an efficient security solution for future m-commerce.

AB  - Internet-of-Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming the norm in both civilian and military settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security abstraction layer for IoT systems based on blockchain, which provides us a logical view of a system that comprises trusted devices. The goal of the proposed layer is to detect and isolate untrusted devices. The proposed abstraction layer provides three services, namely: authorization, authentication, and auditing by using blockchain and smart contract-based approaches. We adopt a hardware based approach, where dedicated hardware modules are used to monitor the behavior of the firmware without incurring excessive performance overhead.

AB  - The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology, which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices. In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each other without a central authority. We also design a data protection mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system.

AB  - Wearable health devices, mobile apps and diagnostic tools revolutionize the medical field by introducing new assisting devices for patients in a way to create comfort, communication and augmented intelligence. Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.

AB  - Blockchains are on the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle 2016 and many start-ups are integrating blockchains into their technology portfolio. While blockchains have emerged in the context of financial applications, non-financial application areas are of interest as well. In this paper, modum.io is presented, a start-up that uses IoT (Internet of Things) sensor devices leveraging blockchain technology to assert data immutability and public accessibility of temperature records, while reducing operational costs in the pharmaceutical supply-chain. The medical industry has many complex and strict environmental control process (e.g., temperature and humidity) to ensure quality control and regulatory compliance over the transport of medical products. The sensor devices monitor the temperature of each parcel during the shipment to fully ensure GDP regulations. All data is transferred to the blockchain where a smart contract assesses against the product attributes. As modum.io is not the only non-financial start-up working with blockchains, a list of areas and other start-ups is provided that aim to reduce bureaucracy, distribute the infrastructure, and saving costs using blockchains.

AB  - In cyber-physical systems (CPS), information flow monitoring is an essential task for detecting errors. Particularly, semantic dependencies between exchanged information play an important role. Due to emergent structure of CPS, this is not plain to accomplish but can be solved by monitoring tools. If several parties are cooperating in a CPS, there is the additional problem that all have to work together to collect those dependency information. In the event of an error, however, the responsible party may no longer want to admit that it caused the error. Therefore, the information required for the investigation must be securely stored so that all parties involved can rely on this information without having to trust the other parties. In this paper, we present our idea of how parties with different interests can cooperate in a CPS without having to trust each other in case of errors. Each party will be separately able to understand dependencies between exchanged information. For this purpose, our approach uses various decentralized storage mechanisms, we particularly also highlight the possibility of using blockchain technology.

AB  - Fog and edge architectures provide a link between centralised clouds and the world of IoT and sensors. The architectures consist of devices of different sizes that coordinate the communication with sensors and cloud services, and that process data from or for the sensors and the cloud locally. In dynamic settings that allow resources to be created, placed, used and removed at any time, advanced orchestration techniques are needed for the activities. Often, these architectures cross organisational boundaries, which causes trust concerns. The origin of data and the identity of sensors or actuators needs to be identified. Additionally, data needs to be stored securely. Orchestration activities across boundaries are subject to a contractual perspective. We present here an architecture pattern that supports trusted orchestration for edge clouds. The W3C Provenance standard is the conceptual foundation of the pattern. Permissioned blockchain technology serves as the platform to implement the provenance framework.

AB  - Vehicular networks enable vehicles to generate and broadcast messages in order to improve traffic safety and efficiency. However, due to the non-trusted environments, it is difficult for vehicles to evaluate the credibilities of received messages. In this paper, we propose a decentralized trust management system in vehicular networks based on blockchain techniques. In this system, vehicles can validate the received messages from neighboring vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the validation result, the vehicle will generate a rating for each message source vehicle. With the ratings uploaded from vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) calculate the trust value offsets of involved vehicles and pack these data into a &amp;#x201C;block&amp;#x201D;. Then, each RSU will try to add their &amp;#x201C;blocks&amp;#x201D; to the trust blockchain which is maintained by all the RSUs. By employing the joint Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, the more total value of offsets (stake) is in the block, the easier RSU can find the nonce for the hash function (proof-of-work). In this way, all RSUs collaboratively maintain an updated, reliable, and consistent trust blockchain. Simulation results reveal that the proposed system is effective and feasible in collecting, calculating, and storing trust values in vehicular networks.

AB  - The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. Firstly, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Secondly, a reputation based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (DBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Thirdly, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs’ individual needs for energy sources while maximizing the operator’s utility. Furthermore, a novel energy allocation mechanism is proposed to allocate the limited renewable energy for EVs. Finally, extensive numerical results are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes.

AB  - In this manuscript, we present a novel method, process and system for calculating dyslexic symptoms, generating metric data for an individual user, community or group in general. We present a mobile multimedia Internet of Things (IoT) based environment, which can capture multimodal smartphone or tab-based user interaction data during dyslexia testing and share it via a mobile edge network, which employs auto-grading algorithms to find dyslexia symptoms. In addition to algorithm-based auto-grading, the captured mobile multimedia payload is stored in a decentralized repository, which can be shared with a medical practitioner for replay and further manual analysis purposes. Since the framework is language-independent and based on Blockchain and a decentralized big data repository, dyslexic patterns and a massive amount of captured multimedia IoT test data can be shared for further clinical research, statistical analysis, and quality assurance. Notwithstanding, our proposed Blockchain and off-chain based decentralized and secure dyslexia data storage, management and sharing framework will allow security, anonymity, and multimodal visualization of the captured test data for mobile users. This paper presents the detailed design, implementation and test results, which demonstrate the strong potential for wider adoption of the dyslexia mobile health management globally.

AB  - Carpooling enables passengers to share a vehicle to reduce traveling time, vehicle carbon emissions and traffic congestion. However, the majority of passengers lean to find local drivers, but querying a remote cloud server leads to an unnecessary communication overhead and an increased response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide local data processing with low latency, but it also raises new security and privacy concerns because users’ private information (e.g., identity, location) could be disclosed when theses information are shared during carpooling. While they can be encrypted before transmission, it makes user matching a challenging task and malicious users can upload false locations. Moreover, carpooling records should be kept in a distributed manner to guarantee reliable data auditability. To address these problems, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving carpooling scheme using blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing to support conditional privacy, one-to-many matching, destination matching and data auditability. Specifically, we authenticate users in a conditionally anonymous way. Also, we adopt private proximity test to achieve one-to-many proximity matching and extend it to efficiently establish a secret communication key between a passenger and a driver. We store all location grids into a tree and achieve get-off location matching using a range query technique. A private blockchain is built to store carpooling records. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of the proposed scheme, and evaluate its performance in terms of computational costs and communication overhead.

AB  - Breaches in online contracts (Service Level Agreements, SLAs) are usually compensated by gift vouchers at present, however as the online contracts emerge towards smart contracts, the breaches could potentially lead to court injunctions over blockchains. This research proposes Probability based Factor Model (PFM) that can be implemented over the blockchain to automatically identify breaches that can cause substantial damage and have high probability for recurrence. PFM can also issue court injunctions for the breaches. The underlying concept in PFM is built upon the notion of factor analysis and stochastic modeling from the discipline of Data Science. High performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu) and docker (a software container platform) were used to emulate contractual environment of three service providers: Redis, MongoDB, and Memcached Servers. The results showed that court injunction(s) was issued only for Redis and MongoDB Servers. Technically, this difference could be attributed to the fact that Memcached is simply used for caching and therefore, it is less prone to breach of contract. Whereas, Redis and MongoDB as databases and message brokers are performing more complex operations and are more likely to cause a breach. This research will benefit enterprises that view breach of contract as a limiting factor for implementation of smart contract in cyber-physical system or internet of things.

AB  - Crowdsensing applications utilize the pervasive smartphone users to collect large-scale sensing data efficiently. The quality of sensing data depends on the participation of highly skilled users. To motivate these skilled users to participate, they should receive enough rewards for compensating their resource consumption. Available incentive mechanisms mainly consider the truthfulness of the mechanism, but mostly ignore the issues of security and privacy caused by a “trustful”center. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain incentive mechanism in crowdsensing applications, in which a cryptocurrency built on blockchains is used as a secure incentive way. High quality contributors will get their payments that are recorded in transaction blocks. The miners will verify the transaction according to the sensing data assessment criteria published by the server. As the transaction information can disclose users' privacy, a node cooperation verification approach is proposed to achieve k-anonymity privacy protection. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we show the feasibility and security of our incentive mechanism.

AB  - The current mobile app development practice, like other large-scale network-centric software projects, is characterized by the use of event notification facilities supporting the exchange of effective and efficient data flows between the application's front-end, usually located on customer's terminal equipment, and the back-end services available within the cloud. In order to avoid the need of setting up the notification infrastructure from scratch for any new application, many cloud service providers and mobile system manufacturing companies provide cloud-based messaging solutions. Such solutions, however, are often characterized by vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the mobile applications' security by violating the privacy and integrity in their operations. In this work, we analyze these issues and posit the potential for the blockchain technology to mitigate such threats.

AB  - The rapid increase in the number and diversity of smart devices connected to the Internet has raised the issues of flexibility, efficiency, availability, security, and scalability within the current IoT network. These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.

AB  - Modern fog network architectures, empowered by IoT applications and 5G communications technologies, are characterized by the presence of a huge number of mobile nodes, which undergo frequent handovers, introducing a significant load on the involved network entities. Considering the distributed and flat nature of these architectures, DMM can be the only viable option for efficiently managing handovers in these scenarios. The existing DMM solutions are capable of providing smooth handovers, but lack robustness from the security point of view. Indeed, DMM depends on external mechanisms for handover security and uses a centralized device, which has obvious security and performance implications in flat architectures where hierarchical dependencies can introduce problems. We propose a new DMM schema based on the blockchain, capable of resolving hierarchical security issues without affecting the network layout, and also satisfying fully distributed security requirements with less consumption of energy.

IoT security and privacy are basic achievement factors for meeting the elevated standards of the innovation to change numerous parts of our general society and economy. The proposed IoT based Blockchain model handles most security dangers, while considering the asset imperatives of numerous IoT devices. Although this architecture is a lightweight, secure and fundamental approach, hypothetically it can be scaled further in areas without compromising its performance and user's anonymity.

AB  - The growing demand for safety in urban environments is supported by monitoring using video surveillance. The need to analyze multiple video-flows from different cameras deployed around the city by heterogeneous owners introduces vulnerabilities and privacy issues. Video frames, timestamps, and camera settings can be digitally manipulated by malicious users; the positions of cameras, their orientation and their mechanical settings can be physically manipulated. Digital and physical manipulations may have several effects, including the change of the observed scene and the potential violation of neighbors' privacy. To face these risks, we introduce BlockSee, a blockchain-based video surveillance system that jointly provides validation and immutability to camera settings and surveillance videos, making them readily available to authorized users in case of events. The encouraging results obtained with BlockSee pave the way to new distributed city-wide monitoring systems.

AB  - Blockchain, as a mechanism to decentralize services, security, and verifiability, offers a peer-to-peer system in which distributed nodes collaboratively affirm transaction provenance. In particular, blockchain enforces continuous storage of transaction history, secured via digital signature, and affirmed through consensus. In this study, we consider the recent surge in blockchain interest as an alternative to traditional centralized systems, and consider the emerging applications thereof. In particular, we assess the key techniques required for blockchain implementation, offering a primer to guide research practitioners. We first outline the blockchain framework in general, and then provide a detailed review of the component data and network structures. Additionally, we consider the breadth of applications to which blockchain has been applied, broadly implicating Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Cloud and Edge computing paradigms, along with many other emerging applications. Finally, we assess the various challenges to blockchain implementation for widespread practical use, considering the security vulnerabilities to majority attacks, selfish mining, and privacy leakage, as well as performance limitations of blockchain platforms in terms of scalability and availability.

AB  - Cloud computing is too often seen as a tactical way to reduce costs, when its most important benefit is as a strategic way to grow revenues. Such revenue growth can come about in a variety of ways, such as through faster innovation of new products, processes, and customer interactions; identifying more customers and closing more purchases; and improving customer relationships through more targeted offers and better service and experiences. Companies that clearly understand the relative magnitude of cost savings and revenue growth and orient themselves toward the latter will better exploit the cloud and related technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things, and blockchain, and thus strengthen their competitive advantage and customer value.

AB  - Car manufacturers are investing heavily in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) because of their increasing popularity. AVs employ a combination of high-tech sensors and innovative algorithms to detect and respond to their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometer, drive-by-wire control systems, and computer vision. When a user requests for a ride share or rent, the responding AV/IoT device does not have the sufficient capability to store, process, or verify each other. Currently, every AV/IoT device typically needs to rely on a trusted third party, which invokes another trust issue. If the trusted third party is rogue or loses credibility, the whole system will collapse. This paper introduces Chained of Things Framework and develops a blockchain-based secure ride-sharing service between passengers and autonomous vehicles. We implement an initial prototype and provide our initial results based on a proposed protocol.

AB  - This work proposes an IoT- and Blockchain-based, distributed system, for automated measuring, storing, and monitoring of water and air quality in environments such as lakes, mountains, urban areas, or factories. Comparable state-of-the-art solutions, require human interaction to access the data or require high power consumption or space requirements, or they are based on centralized architectures. The proposed pollution monitoring system here, on one hand, employs LoRa to address the high power consumption and long-range transmission challenges of IoT protocols. On the other hand, it is designed to be fully decentralized by using the Ethereum Blockchain to store and retrieve the data recorded by IoT sensors. Thus, data integrity is provided without the need for a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and data is collected and captured automatically without any manual operations needed. Observations on the four different types of sensors for measuring Potential Hydrogen (PH), Turbidity, Carbon monoxide (CO), and Carbon dioxide (CO2), revealed a high accuracy with the expected time-lines of measurements, non-falsified experimental values collected and can be used as reliable evidence of presence of pollution.

AB  - Public sector and governments have been actively exploring new technologies to enable the smart services transformation and to achieve strategic objectives such as citizens satisfaction and happiness, services efficiency and cost optimization. The Blockchain technology is a good example of an emerging technology that is attracting government attention. Many government entities such as United Kingdom, Estonia, Honduras, Denmark, Australia, Singapore and others have taken steps to unleash the potential of Blockchain technology. Dubai Government is aiming to become paperless by adopting the Blockchain technology for all transactions by 2021. The Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is playing a vital role in many sectors. It's a revolutionary technology transforming the way we think about trust as it enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need to have trusted central authorities. Blockchain technology promises to overcome security challenges in IoT enabled services such as enabling secure data sharing and data integrity. However, it also introduces new security challenges that should be investigated and tackled. In this paper, we review the literature to identify the potential use cases and application of Blockchain to enable government services. We also synthesized literature related to the security of Blockchain implementations to identify the security benefits, challenges and the proposed solutions. The analysis shows that is huge potential for Blockchain technology to be used in to enable smart government services. This paper also highlights future research in the areas of concerns that required further investigation.

AB  - Blockchain, an emerging decentralized security system, has been applied in many applications, such as bitcoin, smart grid, and Internet-of-Things. However, running the mining process may cost too much energy consumption and computing resource usage on handheld devices, which restricts the use of blockchain in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider deploying edge computing service to support the mobile blockchain. We propose an auction-based edge computing resource allocation mechanism for the edge computing service provider. Since there is competition among miners, the allocative externalities are taken into account in the model. In our auction mechanism, we maximize the social welfare while guaranteeing the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our auction mechanism which shows that the proposed mechanism can efficiently solve the social welfare maximization problem for the edge computing service provider.

AB  - After years of tremendous development and research in digital currency, the most famous Bitcoin industry chain has been gradually completed including mining, exchange, currency exchange, ATM, pervasive digital wallet design and so on. Especially, its blockchain technology has become FinTech organizations' emerging business and research directions, also been applied in the interdisciplinary medical science, supply chain and Internet of things. Digitizing currency can solve many problems in physical currency, such as the rampant counterfeit banknotes. Thus, not only the transparency can be cost-effectively preserved in store's ledger, but also customer's rights and interests can be protected while using the digital wallet. For the government, the regulation and auditing of financial transaction can be made simpler and more convenient for tax collection issue. Digitized transaction details can be much easier to audit by any computing device than manually audit the conventional ledger books. Furthermore, to make merchandise store to use digitized currency much easier, in this paper, we propose and deploy a Bitcoin collection supervision system called BPCSS based on blockchain technology with cloud databases for customers and merchandise stores. The preliminary experimental results via the well-known pervasive digital wallet of Testnet Bitcoin demonstrate the proposed BPCSS can cost-effectively collect payment and supervise the transactions between customer and merchandise store running the implemented NFC-enabled Android Apps.

AB  - Smart communities of the future have features that make them susceptible to a potential loss of privacy for the citizens they serve. These distributed systems need to be responsive to the individual needs of citizen owners yet still maintain the ability to coordinate actions across a neighborhood. The question we wish to address is how can we provide privacy for such open and decentralized environments? We propose the use of Bitcoin blockchain together with cryptographic primitives to guarantee that even in the absence of a trusted centralized control, users can agree on an optimal plan for sharing the community resources while not disclosing any private data. We do a case study on a smart community power sharing protocol. Our approach enables the citizens to coordinate this activity without revealing details of their power consumption. Blockchain provides the means to build and maintain a distributed storage for privacy sensitive energy usage data. Moreover, blockchain provides us with an append-only immutable chain of records which is essential for our system and ensures the users cannot insert fake points to their energy usage history.

AB  - Nowadays, the blockchain is a favorite platform, for instance, for use with cryptocurrency, smart contracts, IoT, and so forth. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not trust each other to maintain states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. The blockchain applies the consensus protocol to verify the block which is distributing the network node. Consensus has many practices such as, for example, Byzantine general problem, Proof of work, and Proof of stake. However, there have not been numerous papers that have undertaken analysis with regard to various aspects, and which have incorporated the adoption summary as appropriate to the application. In this paper, we have provided a technical verification review with regard to the consensus algorithm taken from previous research. The audience will receive a consensus protocol, and the algorithm typically analyzes the application to match which platform is appropriate by viewing the node identity, energy saving and the tolerated power of the adversary, the data model, language, execution, application, and examples. Finally, we finish by presenting several research directions with regard to the consensus protocol.

AB  - Current off-the-shelf Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Flight Data Recorders do not address liability and accountability in the event of an accident. This limitation makes it difficult for necessary stakeholders to determine parties at fault, especially when future operations are expected to be conducted Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLoS). While both on-board and off-board recorders currently exist, the data collected is unsuitable for insurance claims and other legal matters since non-repudiation and tamper-proof mechanisms are not implemented. At the same time, with ongoing developments and improvements to Internet of Things (IoT) telecommunications infrastructure such as LTE-M, 5G, SigFox and NB-IoT protocols, usage of TCP/IP channels and cloud services for UAV Command and Control systems is increasing. This research proposes a real-time, off-board flight logging service using a secure graph database scheme for storage and analysis of flight data recordings. By representing series of logs as an encrypted block chain in graph nodes of a database, it is possible to construct accurate time-lines and enable non-repudiation of operator-UAV and UAV-UAV interactions that provide irrefutable evidence. For proof of concept, this design integrates into the UAV as a Service architecture for BVLOS operations we have proposed in previous publications. The details of the recording protocol, integration into the UAV as a Service platform, data generation simulation and performance results are discussed.

AB  - The trend in the energy market has led in the last few years the increase in demand (eg the spread of electric vehicles) and an increase in volatile renewable energy sources (PV, Wind, etc.), a reduction in the use of fossil fuels, that destabilize the grid leading to black outs. The electricity grid is developing in a distributed network, so the connected energy markets are moving towards a new decentralized structure, where renewable sources and storage facilities (EVs), will have a significant penetration and adoption by energy customers, with the intent to provide sustainable solutions.[1] Balancing the demand and supply of electricity, in a system dominated by random elements, such as solar and wind production that depend on weather conditions, combined with the highly variable demand from domestic users, must lead to a new model of consumers and producers at the same time that is the so-called Prosumer and will be a challenge of great importance. With this paper we want to verify how the smart communities, made up of Prosumers, within smart cities, are the key to the new electricity distribution, based on ICT, IoT and smart metering. A significant contribution will be provided by the Blockchain to make the energy networks and related economic transactions secure and reliable.

AB  - Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency nowadays. Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.

AB  - As proof-of-work blockchains are inherently energy greedy and offer probabilistic guarantees, blockchains based on Byzantine consensus appear as a promising technology to track billions of connected devices. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of prominent blockchains that solve the classic Byzantine consensus problem. Our results show that while offering reasonable throughput their performance usually do not scale to tens of devices and drops dramatically as the number of devices increases. This study motivates the need for solutions that solves the Blockchain consensus problem, a scalable variant of the classic Byzantine consensus problem but dedicated to blockchains.

AB  - With the Internet of Things (IoT), Things are expected to live in different “domains” and “contexts” during their lifetime. Information generated by and associated with Things should be manageable by multiple, diverse stakeholders accordingly. Moreover, the scope of the information related to Things can range from private and confidential to public and auditable. Identification, security, and interoperability in this vivid environment are expected to be challenging. In this paper we discuss how smart contracts and blockchain technologies create the potential for a viable solution. To this end, we present smart contract-based solutions that improve security and information management, we identify new opportunities and challenges, and we provide security recommendations and guidelines.

AB  - Some words mark an era, and "Smart City" is definitely one of these. A Smart City is an urban area where the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are employed to improve citizens' Quality of Life (QoL) in areas such as: mobility, urban surveillance, and energy management. Throughout this paper, we present the #SmartME project, which aims to create an infrastructure and an ecosystem of "smart" services by exploiting existing devices, sensors, and actuators distributed in the city of Messina. We also present the Stack4Things framework, which is the management core of the #SmartME project.

AB  - Numerous IoT applications, like building automation or process control of industrial sites, exist today. These applications inherently have a strong connection to the physical world. Hence, IT security threats cannot only cause problems like data leaks but also safety issues which might harm people. Attacks on IT systems are not only performed by outside attackers but also insiders like administrators. For this reason, we present ongoing work on a Byzantine fault tolerant configuration management system (CMS) that provides control over administrators, restrains their rights, and enforces separation of concerns. We reach this goal by conducting a configuration management process that requires multi-party authorization for critical configurations to prevent individual malicious administrators from performing undesired actions. Only after a configuration has been authorized by multiple experts, it is applied to the targeted devices. For the whole configuration management process, our CMS guarantees accountability and traceability. Lastly, our system is tamper-resistant as we leverage Hyperledger Fabric, which provides a distributed execution environment for our CMS and a blockchain-based distributed ledger that we use to store the configurations. A beneficial side effect of this approach is that our CMS is also suitable to manage configurations for infrastructure shared across different organizations that do not need to trust each other.

AB  - With the development of the Internet of Things, a complex CPS system has emerged and is becoming a promising information infrastructure. In the CPS system, the loss of control over user data has become a very serious challenge, making it difficult to protect privacy, boost innovation, and guarantee data sovereignty. In this article, we propose HyperNet, a novel decentralized trusted computing and networking paradigm, to meet the challenge of loss of control over data. HyperNet is composed of the intelligent PDC, which is considered as the digital clone of a human individual; the decentralized trusted connection between any entities based on blockchain as well as smart contract; and the UDI platform, enabling secure digital object management and an identifier-driven routing mechanism. HyperNet has the capability of protecting data sovereignty, and has the potential to transform the current communication-based information system to the future data-oriented information society.

AB  - The Blockchain paradigm provides a popular mechanism for establishing trust and consensus in distributed environments. While Blockchain technology is currently primarily deployed in crypto-currency systems like Bitcoin, the concept is also expected to emerge as a key component of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), enabling novel applications in digital health, smart energy, asset tracking and smart transportation. As Blockchain networks evolve to industrial deployments with large numbers of geographically distributed nodes, the block transfer and processing delays arise as a critical issue which may create greater potential for forks and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Motivated by these issues, we develop stochastic network models to capture the Blockchain evolution and dynamics and analyze the impact of the block dissemination delay and hashing power of the member nodes on Blockchain performance in terms of the overall block generation rate and required computational power for launching a successful attack. The results provide useful insight in crucial design issues, e.g., how to adjust the ‘difficulty-of-work’ in the presence of delay so as to achieve a target block generation rate or appropriate level of immunity from adversarial attacks. We employ a combination of analytical calculations and simulation experiments to investigate both stationary and transient performance features, and demonstrate close agreement with measurements on a wide-area network testbed running the Ethereum protocol.

AB  - In recent years, Blockchain has been expected to create a secure mechanism for exchanging not only for cryptocurrency but also for other types of assets without the need for a powerful and trusted third-party. This could enable a new era of the Internet usage called the Internet of Value (IoV) in which any types of assets such as intellectual and digital properties, equity and wealth can be digitized and transferred in an automated, secure, and convenient manner. In the IoV, Blockchain is used to guarantee security of transactions that the transactions are nearly impossible to be altered; thus it is impractical to retract once a transaction is confirmed. Therefore, to strengthen the IoV, before making any transactions it is crucial to evaluate trust between participants for reducing the risk of dealing with malicious peers. In this article, we clarify the concept of IoV and propose a trust-based IoV model including a system architecture, components and features. Then, we present a trust platform in the IoV considering two concepts, Experience and Reputation, originated from Social Networks for evaluating trust between two any peers in the IoV. The Experience and Reputation are characterized and calculated using mathematical models with analysis and simulation in the IoV environment. We believe this paper consolidates the understandings about IoV technologies and demonstrates how trust is evaluated and used to strengthen the IoV. It also opens important research directions on both IoV and trust in the future.

AB  - In the past ten years distributed ledgers such as Bitcoin and smart contracts that can run code autonomously have seen an exponential growth both in terms of research interest and in terms of industrial and financial applications. These find a natural application in the area of Sensor Networks and Cyber-Physical Systems. However, the incentive architecture of blockchains requires massive computational resources for mining, delays in the confirmation of transactions and, more importantly, continuously growing transaction fees, which are ill-suited to systems in which services may be provided by resource-limited devices and confirmation times and transaction costs should be kept minimal, ideally absent. We focus on a new block-less, fee-less paradigm for distributed ledgers suitable for the WSN, IoT and CPS in which transactions are nodes of a directed acyclic graph, that overcomes the limitations of blockchains for these applications, and where e.g. sensors can be at the same time issuers of transactions and validators of previous transactions. In particular, we present and release open-source a simulation environment that can be easily extended and analysed, and confirms the available results on the performance of the network.

AB  - The concept of cyber-physical production systems is highly discussed amongst researchers and industry experts, however, the implementation options for these systems rely mainly on obsolete technologies. Despite the fact that the blockchain is most often associated with cryptocurrency, it is fundamentally wrong to deny the universality of this technology and the prospects for its application in other industries. For example, in the insurance sector or in a number of identity verification services. This article discusses the deployment of the CPPS backbone network based on the Ethereum private blockchain system. The structure of the network is described as well as its interaction with the help of smart contracts, based on the consumption of cryptocurrency for various operations.

AB  - A fresh look at the way secure communications is currently being done has been undertaken as a consequence of the large hacking's that have taken place recently. A plausible option maybe a return to the future via Morse code using how a quantum bit (Qubit) reacts when entangled to suggest a cypher. This quantum cyphers uses multiple properties of unique entities that have many random radicals which makes hacking more difficult that traditional 'Rivest-Shamir-Adleman' (RSA), 'Digital Signature Algorithm' (DSA) or 'Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm' (ECDSA). Additional security is likely by Backchannelling (slipstreaming) Quantum Morse code (Q-Morse) keys composed of living and non-living entities. This means Blockchain ledger history (forwards-backwards) is audited during an active session. Verification keys are Backchannelling (slipstreaming) during the session (e.g. train driver must incrementally activate a switch otherwise the train stops) using predicted-expected sender-receiver properties as well as their past history of disconformities to random radicals encountered. In summary, Quantum Morse code (Q-Morse) plausibly is the enabler to additional security by Backchannelling (slipstreaming) during a communications session.

AB  - In identity federations, users assigned to identity providers (IDPs) can access applications operated by service providers (SPs) without SP-specific credentials for authentication and authorization. While OpenID Connect and SAML are the two most widely adopted federation standards, using them inherently results in a trade-off between data quality guarantees and scalability, given how they handle the Metadata about the involved IDPs and SPs. This paper presents a novel approach for federation membership and federation Metadata management based on Distributed Ledger Technology. It applies the core idea of Certificate Transparency, as known from Global-PKI certificate authorities for X.509v3 server certificates, to SAML federation Metadata; therefore, it achieves OpenID Connect's federation building flexibility without losing the significant advantages of traditional SAML federations. An implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric is used to evaluate typical use cases by measuring impacts on Metadata distribution latency and Metadata size, and to discuss the feasibility of the presented approach.

AB  - With the rapid development of cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technologies, platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger began to support various types of smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer protocols intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts have broad range of applications, such as financial services, prediction markets and Internet of Things (IoT), etc. However, there are still many challenges such as security issues and privacy disclosure that await future research. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview on blockchain powered smart contracts. First, we give a systematic introduction for smart contracts, including the basic framework, operating mechanisms, platforms and programming languages. Second, application scenarios and existing challenges are discussed. Finally, we describe the recent advances of smart contract and present its future development trends, e.g., parallel blockchain. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.

AB  - In the times we are living, data protection infringements, at local, national or international level, are a daily occurrence, highlighting how important is the problem of users' awareness and “consent” about what data should or not be shared. A vast number of service providers strives to have access to users' personal data. While users may be aware of sharing their data with services they receive, they may be still unaware if their data is passing in others' hands and unknown third parties. But the sharing of personal data remains unavoidable, in this always connected digital era, contextualized services are not only fancy desires, they could save money, time, and even lives. The problem becomes even more complicate if we try to consider the devices around us: how to share devices we own, so that we can receive pervasive services, based on our contexts and device functionalities. The European Authority has provided regulations about personal data protection, but there are still significant differences in the ways each EU member state would implement the protection of privacy and personal data in national laws, policies, and practices. The tool that should empower users with the personal data protection has to face two problems: data privacy and control. Due to the lack of central authorities, blockchain based technologies would seem fit for the challenge, but such solutions are not fully exploited. One possible reason could be that distributed architectures alone do not achieve privacy of data. In this paper we tackle the challenge of a novel Personal Data Store, by making use of a distributed architecture, based on the Ethereum framework, together with an ontology to model user profile and data/device sharing towards services. Such solution, The Decentralized Identity Manager, solves personal data protection by offering a unique endpoint, without any central authority, where users can manage their data/device access, their privacy levels, and grant or deny sharing consent, every time services ask for personal data.

AB  - Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is probably going, in the near future, to disrupt B2B and B2C interactions even more than the advent of the World Wide Web, thanks to the transfer of trust from personal and commercial relationships to computing algorithms. However, a less commonly perceived property of DLT is that of enabler of decentralized computing. In this paper, we explore the use of DLT to innovate Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems.

AB  - Applications of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) in IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are rapidly emerging. However, developing correct and resilient smart contracts for these use cases is even less understood than it is for cryptocurrency-based contracts. This paper presents an initial approach for generating smart contracts for coordinating the usage of cyber-physical system elements from UML statecharts. While the current target platform is Ethereum, our approach can easily be extended to other blockchain platforms.

AB  - Recently, with the tremendous development of crypto-currencies, distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g., blockchain) has attracted significant attention. The traditional Internet was originally design to handle the exchange of information. With DLT, we will have the Internet of value. Although, DLT has a great potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems, the existing DLT has a number of drawbacks (e.g., scalability) that prevent it from being used as a generic platform for distributed ledger across the globe. In this paper, we present a novel virtualization approach to address the challenges in the existing DLT systems. Specifically, in the proposed virtualization for DLT (vDLT), the underlying resources (e.g., hardware, compute, storage, network, and so on) are abstracted. By providing a logical view of resources, vDLT can significantly improve the performance, facilitate system evolution, and simplify DLT management and configuration. Several use cases of vDLT are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed vDLT.

AB  - Trading commercial property currently involves several middlemen who are extra time-consuming and cost-consuming elements in a transaction. With recent blockchain-based smart contract innovations, it is possible to use distributed applications (Dapps) for disintermediating third parties and enabling direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. The blockchain serves as an immutable, event-recording ledger that facilitates trust-less P2P transactions. The Evareium system is a distributed application for enabling blockchain-based commercial-property trades that make middlemen superfluous and consequently, investors benefit from cost reductions, faster transaction times, greater transparency and reduced regulatory burdens. As a consequence of the Evareium system, investors and other stake-holders are able to avail a direct interface with the creation and dissemination of optimal financial gains from such investments without interdiction. The corresponding Evareium token is structured for governing platform-related incentives. The Evareium token is also intended for Internet-of-Things (IoT) based hotelmanagement services such as controlling hotel-room blindfolds, A/C, smart keys, checkin, spa, restaurant, room service, and so on.

AB  - The volume of data traffic has increased exponentially due to the explosive growth of IoT devices and the arrival of many new IoT applications. Due to the large volume of data generated from IoT devices, limited bandwidth, high latency, and real-time analysis requirements, the conventional centralized network architecture cannot meet users' requirements. Intensive real-time data analysis is one of the major challenges in current state-of-the-art centralized architectures due to the ubiquitous deployment of different types of sensors. To address the current challenges and adhere to the principles of architectural design, we are proposing a SoftEdgeNet model, which is a novel SDN-based distributed layered network architecture with a blockchain technique for a sustainable edge computing network. At the fog layer, we introduce an SDN-based secure fog node architecture to mitigate security attacks and provide real-time analytics services. We are also proposing a flow rule partition, and allocation algorithm at the edge of the network. The evaluation result shows our proposed model allows for a significant improvement of the interactions in real time data transmission. In terms of the ability to mitigate flooding attacks, the bandwidth is maintained above 9 Mb/s until the attack rates exceed 2000 PPS in the hardware environment and the bandwidth remained almost unchanged in the software environment. In the case of scalability of the proposed model, our proposed algorithm has performed better and proceeded linearly with the increase in traffic volume.

AB  - The work shows a novel solution to create an access key which can be used within the transactions of electronic currencies, blockchain as well as in the field of computer security to guarantee a high level of secrecy, but also, with a high level of certainty, to provide a person identity through Information Fusion (IF) techniques and biometric data encryption. Specifically, two non-connected areas have been joined, Face Biometrics and Public-key Cryptography. This choice was taken in order to get through the limits these two approaches have found singularly and to give a suitable solution in the context of electronic and digital exchanges (electro-currencies, Internet of Things). An innovative and original algorithm has been developed, which can do fusion operations between Face Biometrics and numerical data, that is an algorithm of Hybrid Information Fusion, named FIF (Face Information Fusion), we decided to use a digital face as a biometric component, and the product of two prime numbers as a numerical component, that is the module in RSA algorithm.

AB  - Turnkey solutions that combine energy-efficient remote sensing and secure communication of telemetry are desirable in data collection, risk control and situation appraisal with the large scale deployment of resource constrained Internet of Things devices. In this paper, a new low-cost physical unclonable function (PUF) based temperature sensor for secure remote temperature sensing is proposed. The design exploits the approximately linear positive temperature coefficient of CMOS inverter in super-threshold operation to calibrate the running frequency of ring oscillator (RO) in a reconfigurable RO PUF at different temperature. The RO frequency corresponding to the sensed temperature is fed into a randomizer seeded by the input challenge to select new RO pairs for comparison to generate a random, unique and physically unclonable digital tag, which is valid for a selected input challenge to a target device at a particular temperature. Using only standard logic cells and a very simple structure, the proposed temperature sensor can be easily implemented on FPGA and integrated into other digital systems. It protects the integrity of the sensed information by preventing falsified sensor data and masquerade sensing node. The FPGA implementation of our proposed design has demonstrated the feasibility of making a trust temperature telemetry system out of PUF.

AB  - Summary form only given. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The ability to cope with random faults, unexpected disruptions, and targeted attacks is an increasingly important aspect of dependable systems, which is why Byzantine fault tolerance has become an active field of research in the past two decades. With new application scenarios and technologies such as trusted-computing hardware features, the Internet of Things, and Industry 4.0 emerging, existing approaches towards Byzantine consensus (i.e., Byzantine fault-tolerant replication) need to be revisited. Most notably, this is true with regard to a novel use case of Byzantine consensus that promises a revolution in several aspects of our society: resilient blockchains. The Workshop on Byzantine Consensus and Resilient Blockchains (BCRB '18) gives researchers a forum to promote and discuss ideas on open challenges in the domain of Byzantine consensus in general and resilient blockchains as well as distributed ledgers in particular. In an effort to foster discussion and information exchange between the two (overlapping) communities, the workshop furthermore aims at determining new application areas for Byzantine fault tolerance and blockchain. Apart from elaborating on further use cases, BCRB '18 gives researchers an opportunity to present system support and techniques for improving the resilience and scalability of Byzantine fault-tolerant systems, for example, by exploiting recently developed hardware mechanisms. Finally, the workshop provides a platform to identify new threat and attack scenarios for Byzantine consensus and blockchain technologies, and to discuss open problems and possible future research directions.
