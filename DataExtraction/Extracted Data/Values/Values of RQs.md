# Values of Research Questions on BC-IoT Systems

## Why do IoT systems integrate blockchains?

### Improvement Objectives

Improve quality of IoT system or systems:

- Security in terms of integrity: ISO/IEC 25010 defines integrity of the ability of a system to prevent unauthorised access and modification of data and computer program. Works that use BC as immutable storage of some records or procedures fall into this category.
- Security in terms of authenticity: ISO/IEC 25010 defines authenticity as the degree that the identity of a subject or resource can be proved to be the one claimed. Works that use BC as authentication mechanisms fall into this category. 
- Security in terms of accountability: ISO/IEC 25010 defines accountability as the degree which actions or an entity can be traced uniquely to it. 
- Security in terms of confidentiality: ISO/IEC 25010 defines confidentiality as the degree that a system ensures that the data are accessible only to those authorized to have access. 
- Security in terms of non-repudiation: ISO/IEC 25010 defines non-repudiation as the degree that an actor cannot deny that an event or action has taken place. 
- Reliability in terms of availability: ISO/IEC 25010 defines availability as the degree to which the system is operational and accessible when required for use.
- Performance in terms of time behaviour of the system: ISO/IEC 25010 defines the degree to which the response processing time and throughput of the system when performing its functions meet the requirements.
- Compability in terms of interoperability: ISO/IEC 25010 defines interoperability as the degree to which two or more systems, products, or components can exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged. Works that uses BC to bridge IoT systems or devices from different organizations with different formats tend to fall into this category. 

Add functionality to IoT system or systems:
