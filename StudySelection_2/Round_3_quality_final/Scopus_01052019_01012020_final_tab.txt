GIDDI makes IoT application development more efficient and cost-effective via enabling (1) sharing and reuse of existing IoT devices owned and maintained by different providers, and (2) deployment of new IoT devices that is supported by a revenue generation scheme for their providers. More specifically, this paper proposes a distributed IoT ledger that is specifically designed for managing the metadata needed for GIDDI. This GIDDI Blockchain is IoT-owned (i.e., it is not controlled by any individual or organization) and is IoT-scaled (i.e., it can support the discovery and reuse of millions of IoT devices). In addition to the GIDDI Blockchain, this paper outlines the design of a GIDDI Marketplace that provides the functionality needed for IoT device registration, query, integration, payment and security via the proposed GIDDI Blockchain. Finally, the paper outlines a prototype GIDDI Blockchain implementation and discusses future research in this area. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072771525&doi=10.1109%2fICIOT.2019.00034&partnerID=40&md5=3321d9c28f6842ec32211e7fa05843df//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8815688/	internal-pdf://2040651431/08815688.pdf

The privacy, reliability, and integrity of communications must be ensured so that actions can be appropriate, safe, accurate, and implemented promptly after receiving actionable information. In this work, we present a multi-Tier methodology consisting of an authentication and trust-building/distribution framework designed to ensure the safety and validity of the information exchanged in the system. Blockchain protocols and Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attributes (RF-DNA) combine to provide a hardware-software codesigned system for enhanced device identity and overall system trustworthiness. Our threat model accounts for counterfeiting, breakout fraud, and bad mouthing of one entity by others. Entity trust (e.g., IoT devices) depends on quality and level of participation, quality of messages, lifetime of a given entity in the system, and the number of known 'bad' (non-consensus) messages sent by that entity. Based on this approach to trust, we are able to adjust trust upward and downward as a function of real-Time and past behavior, providing other participants with a trust value upon which to judge information from and interactions with the given entity. This approach thereby reduces the potential for manipulation of an IoT system by a bad or byzantine actor. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074841556&doi=10.1109%2fiThings%2fGreenCom%2fCPSCom%2fSmartData.2019.00191&partnerID=40&md5=6150bb5ed09aa5544f93bdb4f36f346e//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8875291/	internal-pdf://3617318127/08875291.pdf

We use a decentralized storage network for reducing the load on the vendor when distributing patches toward IoT devices, and eliminating central points of failure. Unlike existing peer-to-peer file sharing networks which have a fundamental availability problem for unpopular files, our protocol utilizes blockchain-based smart contracts to incentivize independent peers, termed distributors, by means of cryptocurrency payments. A vendor of IoT devices deploys a smart contract with a deposit, which acts as a publicly verifiable binding bid for delivery of patches to a specific set of IoT endpoints. Distributors will compete for delivering the updates to the desired IoT devices and present proofs-of-distribution in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. We address the fair exchange problem between distributors and the consuming IoT devices by utilizing a variation of the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) protocol, ensuring that the process is trustless. This can encourage the participation of a large number of distributors, and thus facilitate a rapid scale-out of the system. Finally, we present and evaluate a prototype implementation combining the BitTorrent network with the cryptocurrency Ethereum. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066926531&doi=10.1016%2fj.pmcj.2019.04.010&partnerID=40&md5=6b8b5307903ce84f0450f5d96482db1d//https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/273419/1-s2.0-S1574119219X00061/1-s2.0-S1574119218306175/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEGIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIF9HkGNgxzWNcWOVgq9RynbEWHOQKTuCUqFq6%2FqfLQMaAiBx6%2FthXl8h8d8R8YXg2gbzKHvR3TXwHIzbWIetkQpA%2BCq9Awj7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAMaDDA1OTAwMzU0Njg2NSIMwPaMMmqUdfXAduBrKpEDF%2BdqPk2Zb1JK8LJvlC0aMVPQkjgMc7gh6MZu0ehM5kqrYf1jyxkUNnJ9VdUmUBlY4H0Yvt4dbeJ1%2BIizdcLTxSe9lh%2FzbkYYFGaSXvfmvnxQPNw2IgBg%2BlOHMF%2Bec1WaJPMQHmwZsyl4oOCLvjGvOs2E154cizTGawPZXlZDT1jOi2z7tHaGn1vEgZxTqAVr7bgdJTOQF9AxLU4Xpa4%2Bf8vCYOV4revvaEVR%2F6ZhWxzpFKKZnC6VorpsXlBrxeIMDQwv%2FO6tNpaOrYwQG%2F0l60tBtCz5SC2FH2I1NueZKSs1fYE89UaDHBj%2FXNSspNyg4cJN1USY%2FuqfWWe3PfH3hYa3FbFyufTsNvqVsVDq19Clki9QyNg30OALm40vUSa7aA%2F6MLXc1K4oOzquUc7kFVikATwL2NGKRneln3Liu7ZHtErYQh5vL3ec1eUzAlXzNvKXv8gxAzocLHaA7ENoeoBn8rvuef1ona55Z2IBgZ%2BpyBZvrD8kE3cadCo4CiTCjcgXKx0Q7QdDY12q7LZ%2FQNgw9%2BaZ%2BAU67AF%2F5rFBsS8EfDdeQ649BsClqYsWH7%2F7Di8P6iKJX2gBaeQrjyQpFXRA9i4lp4lpjgIErPFGfwx2rLFnw8QoWiiuAAu%2BI992d09tZw1m6J0aFSGlJdB6yzY2KtLgbRShIyBSA9BP4N4MHgXqD9x7MKphasFfrwf2DmPJGSlsiwHEDb37VCLqxLPWtY7Ng2qhgg0mN0463NPqFdtymZQvE1%2BENeJUCmnN%2FSh%2FxLkf90eLaxQ8y4enqrOojfSAuxzYAmwzVMWn5pyKcFs%2Bm2BTCSLeIO68gXdoOI0wByOH0il9vp13UgcdMHQS%2FKAqQg%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200709T024517Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY6KB65T7G%2F20200709%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=abc5ffae646de97561d2ca42fc171617962d2ed71cc2fee349f2f331e614de78&hash=94a3564eb2c0668d0afa433b72cef6fd16191d6b5ae26a1ffa8a655672ba3a14&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1574119218306175&tid=spdf-ad5e7baa-db92-455d-8288-2d11b8f1f945&sid=61b602e14859f84f0679e431df325b728027gxrqa&type=client	internal-pdf://1734575189/O-2019-IoTPatchPool_ Incentivized delivery net.pdf

The traditional access control protocols are not suitable for IoT mainly due to a massive scale, ubiquitous connectivity and distributed nature. Blockchain based access control approaches provide decentralized security but they involve scalability problem, high transaction fees, a significant delay, and computational overhead that is not acceptable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, data published on the blockchain are public which is not ideal for many scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a new decentralized access control system based on the Tangle which empowers the users to dictate the access to their resource. In our proposed decentralized access control model the policies and access rights are published on the Tangle which guarantees distributed auditability and prevents the user from fraudulently denying the granted access rights. The main contribution of the paper is to provide privacy of the policy by leveraging Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) data communication protocol.

The recent, exponential rise in adoption of the most disparate Internet of Things (IoT) devices and technologies has reached also Water supply chains, drumming up substantial research and innovation interest towards developing reliable, auditable and transparent traceability systems. Current IoT-based traceability and provenance systems for water supply chains are built on top of centralized infrastructures and this leaves room for unsolved issues and major concerns, including data integrity, tampering and single points of failure. Blockchains, the distributed ledger technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, represent a new and innovative technological approach to realizing decentralized trustless systems. This will also eliminate corruption due to unmaintained record of sources. Indeed, the inherent properties of this digital technology provide fault-tolerance, immutability, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction records, as well as coherent digital representations of physical assets and autonomous transaction executions. This paper presents Aqua-chain, a fully decentralized, blockchain-based traceability solution for Water supply chain management, able to seamless integrate IoT devices producing and consuming digital data along the chain. To effectively assess Aqua-chain, first, we defined a classical use-case within the given vertical domain, namely from-supplier-to-buyer. Then, we developed and deployed such use-case, achieving traceability using blockchain implementation, Ethereum. Finally, we evaluated and compared the performance deployments, in terms of latency, CPU, and network usage, also highlighting its main pros and cons. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072825753&doi=10.1109%2fICCCT2.2019.8824945&partnerID=40&md5=8fd66850f2e37ffe27517fb6d13d9151//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8824945/	internal-pdf://3386519677/08824945.pdf

This is why information in intelligent agriculture requires protection from network security to ensure data privacy and integrity. This study proposes applying dark web technology to ensure the privacy of blockchains and servers. The study will monitor packet transmission frequency in intelligent agriculture to prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. The main features of system include: (1) An identity authentication mechanism, (2) secure transmission of information, (3) establishment of private blockchains, (4) a faster, improved authentication system for blockchain information, and (5) resistance against DDOS attacks. The proposed scheme can safeguard network security for the IoT as well as the servers by way of applying dark web technology, which can avoid exposure of blockchains and server ID addresses and thus in turn lower the risks of DDOS attack damages.

How to encourage the willingness to cooperate and share information between these entities has always been one of the major challenges in the field of supply chain management. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can help entities get real-time data in the supply chain to share the key information and reduce costs. However, the supply chain not only needs to know how to gather the data but also ensures that the data processed is not leaked. Since Blockchain, as the main technology of Bitcoin, has the advantages of traceability and anti-counterfeiting, blockchain is the right tool to tackle the date sharing problem in supply chain. In this paper, we connect IIoT devices to the blockchain by combining the monitoring and recording of IIoT devices and storing real-time data in the network by smart contract. In addition, a blockchain-based supply chain structure is proposed. This structure provides collaboration solutions between different entities in the supply chain.

The smart city concepts allows to handle the new challenges and issues created by this growth by applying a wide range of technologies that can provide citizens with a better living environment. Smart agriculture will play an important part of smart cities, as a sustainable and high quality food supply chain is crucial to facilitate the grow of human agglomerates. In this context, European laws imposes very strict requirements in the food industry, in order to ensure that food provenance is always guaranteed. Such fine-grained traceability can be only achieved by applying state-of-the-art technologies. In this paper, we present BRUSCHETTA, a blockchain-based application for the traceability and the certification of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) supply chain. EVOO is an emblematic food product for Italy, but it is also one of the most falsified ones. BRUSCHETTA provides a blockchain-based system to enforce the certification of this product by tracing its entire supply chain: from the plantation to the shops. The goal is to enable the final customer to access a tamper-proof history of the product, including the farming, harvesting, production, packaging, conservation, and transportation processes. BRUSCHETTA leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in order to interconnect sensors dedicated to EVOO quality control, and to let them operate on the blockchain. We also provide a support for the correct tailoring of the BRUSCHETTA blockchain system, and we propose a mechanism for its dynamic auto-tuning to optimize it in case of high loads. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070866376&doi=10.1109%2fSMARTCOMP.2019.00049&partnerID=40&md5=6ffbc2b8a78cd3535a21c4e63075d2d7//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784020/	internal-pdf://3616831740/08784020.pdf

This incrementing demand raises a plethora of concern cognate to a smart home system in terms of scalability, efficiency, and security. All these issues are tedious to manage, and the existing studies lack the granularity for surmounting them. Considering such a requisite of security and efficiency as a quandary at hand, this article presents a secure and efficient smart home architecture, which incorporates the blockchain and the cloud computing technologies for a cumulated solution. Because of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, it can serve the processing services and make the transaction copy of the collected sensible user data from smart home. To ensure the security of smart home network, our proposed model utilizes the multivariate correlation analysis technique to analyze the network traffic and identify the correlation between traffic features.

In its application, IoT-based environmental monitoring systems are composed of one or more sensors placed in various locations and connected to each other using certain protocols. The problem arises when thousands of IoT devices connected together in one network and using the server-client connection model which raises several works in the synchronization process and access control management. This kind of network depends on a server as the center of control management that work as storing and distributing data from the sensor so that any data comes from the server is considered correct. To overcome this problem, it is proposed an IoT system that uses Blockchain technology which is a distributed data structure that forms blocks that do not require central authority and verification from third parties. From the experiments conducted can be evaluated that blockchain communication is much slower compared to MQTT communication protocol in terms of speed. The data transmission between node is measured with an average delay of 200ms.

Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation. © 2013 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075933670&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2940227&partnerID=40&md5=e550b313e3461db7ba92b074532d547b//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08830460.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8830460&isnumber=8600701&ref=	internal-pdf://0943947739/Y.P-2019-Blockchain-Driven IoT for Food Tracea.pdf

Studies on overcoming the limitations of scalability and stability in a centralized IoT operating environment by employing distributed blockchain technology have been actively conducted. However, the nature of IoT that ensures connectivity with multiple objects at any time and any place increases security threats. Further, it extends the influence of the cyber world into the physical domain, resulting in serious damage to human life and property. Therefore, we aim to study a method to increase the security of IoT devices and effectively extend them simultaneously. To this end, we analyze the authentication methods and limitations of traditional IoT devices and examine cases for improving IoT environments by using blockchain technology. Accordingly, we propose a framework that allows IoT devices to be securely connected and extended to other devices by automatically evaluating security using blockchain technology and the whitelist. The method proposed in this paper restricts the extension of devices vulnerable to security risks by imposing penalties and allows only devices with high security to be securely and quickly authenticated and extended without user intervention.

The DL-Tags solution steps into this environment to offer a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable management of Smart Tags during a product's lifecycle. The solution is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and uses the Ethereum blockchain to mediate interactions between the stakeholders during a product's exchange process. By reaching a consensus on the product's description and state logged on the blockchain, all involved stakeholders and product consumers can verify the product's authenticity without revealing their identity.

Unfortunately, because of the unique characteristics of resource constraints, short-range communication, and self-organization in IoT, it always resorts to the cloud or fog nodes for outsourced computation and storage, which has brought about a series of novel challenging security and privacy threats. For this reason, one of the critical challenges of having numerous IoT devices is the capacity to manage them and their data. A specific concern is from which devices or Edge clouds to accept join requests or interaction requests. This paper discusses a design concept for developing the IoT data management platform, along with a data management and lineage traceability implementation of the platform based on blockchain and smart contracts, which approaches the two major challenges: how to implement effective data management and enrich rational interoperability for trusted groups of linked Things; And how to settle conflicts between untrusted IoT devices and its requests taking into account security and privacy preserving. Experimental results show that the system scales well with the loss of computing and communication performance maintaining within the acceptable range, works well to effectively defend against unauthorized access and empower data provenance and transparency, which verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the design concept to provide privacy, fine-grained, and integrity data management over the IoT devices by introducing the blockchain-based data management platform. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073594592&doi=10.1109%2fICCChinaW.2019.8849969&partnerID=40&md5=3ce7b46d92b5422ff248bed173d6a9fb//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8849969/	internal-pdf://0352406217/08849969.pdf

Computing resource trading unavoidably happens in edge-assisted IoT. However, efficient computing resource trading cannot be achieved because of the 'cold start' and 'long return' problems. To address these challenges, we propose to use a credit-based payment for fast computing resource trading in edge-assisted blockchain-enabled IoT; therefore, the IoT nodes can finish fast payment and frequent trading by borrowing resource coins from other IoT nodes based on their credit values. In our resource-coin loan problem, we propose an iterative double-auction-based algorithm, where a broker is introduced to solve the loan allocation problem and to determine the size of the loan each lender would provide to each borrower. Furthermore, the broker enforces specific loan pricing rules to induce the borrowers and lenders to bid truthfully. Then, the hidden privacy information could be extracted to achieve the optimal resource-coin allocation and loan pricing. The proposed algorithm can maximize the economic benefits while protecting privacy. Simulations showed that the proposed algorithm can maximize social welfare.

The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem)in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground)vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs)is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs’ requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network's backbone to transfer EVs’ requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid.

Due to the large number of IoT devices and the different administrative domains in which they operate, traditional approaches involving a Centralized server for managing Authorizations will not be scalable or efficient. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Capability-Based Access Control framework using IOTA (DCACI); IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger that enables fee-less micro transactions for the IoT. The DCACI framework enables complete privacy and integrity of the Capability tokens using IOTA's Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) technology. It enables device owners and users to Grant, Update, Delegate and Revoke the capability tokens. The proposed DCACI framework has been implemented as a proof-of-concept on a resource constrained machine; the results indicate that it is capable of scaling up to large-scale infrastructure such as a Smart City, having millions of IoT devices. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073911895&doi=10.1109%2fWF-IoT.2019.8767356&partnerID=40&md5=d53c777edc8ef8a81188a28026524424//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8767356/	internal-pdf://2306743118/08767356.pdf

Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial process. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility. © 2013 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074640851&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2948269&partnerID=40&md5=a9289b3441e559018e700d493284a410//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08876654.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8876654&isnumber=8600701&ref=	internal-pdf://0719885386/A-2019-Estimating service quality in industria.pdf

Due to the nature of the treatment and side effects on regular lifestyles, maintaining quality of life in the home environment is a challenging task. Sometimes within a home environment, a cancer patient's situation changes abruptly, as the functionality of certain organs deteriorate, which affects their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain and off-chain based framework which will allow multiple medical and ambient intelligent IoT sensors to capture quality of life information from one's home environment and securely share it with one's community of interest. Using our proposed framework, both transactional records and multimedia big data - consisting of a user's physiological as well as mental states - can be shared with an oncologist or palliative care unit for real-time decision support. We have also developed Blockchain-based data analytics, which will allow a clinician to visualize the immutable history of the patient's data available from an in-home secure monitoring system for a better understanding of a patient's current or historical states. We further designed a generic oncologist smart contract and digital wallet for different stakeholders to automate the treatment plan of a particular patient. Finally, we will present our current implementation status, which provides significant encouragement for further development. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073913274&doi=10.1109%2fIWCMC.2019.8766496&partnerID=40&md5=9d6bb1dc47e2bfe72b3e8cb36fa22c5d//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766496/	internal-pdf://1244316437/08766496.pdf

However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067334318&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2019.2908497&partnerID=40&md5=d475f43c167702ebe5697b21fc4e4d86//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8678450/	internal-pdf://1335354340/08678450.pdf

It has been applied to stock trading, supply chain auditing, crowd-funding, energy trading, and Internet-of-Things. Specifically, in Internet-of-Things applications, how the data is transmitted before reaching a blockchain platform reliably is a challenging issue. In this paper, we focus on an energy trading scenario with Internet-of-Things blockchain applications for energy trading. In this scenario, energy generated from renewable sources can be traded in a peer-To-peer manner among micro-grids. This requires a high level of data communication reliability. Blockchain is adopted as an effective decentralized transaction management solution. In particular, we propose a proof-of-concept for reliable data transmission from smart meters to the blockchain based on Sigfox technology and the Ethereum. To enhance reliability, we configure the base station antenna as a block-based mode and propose a physical data layer for wireless communication. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed wireless communication system for the blockchain. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074221632&doi=10.1109%2fJCSSE.2019.8864210&partnerID=40&md5=d0cfd48a0886e2b53c6b4f76838f9d57//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8864210/	internal-pdf://3455528526/08864210.pdf

The DECENTER's Fog Computing Platform is developed to support Big Data pipelines, which start from the Internet of Things (IoT), such as cameras that provide video-streams for subsequent analysis. It is used to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms across the Edge-Fog-Cloud computing continuum which provide benefits to applications, including high Quality of Service (QoS), improved privacy and security, lower operational costs and similar. In this article, we present a trust management architecture for DECENTER that relies on the use of blockchain-based Smart Contracts (SCs) and specifically designed trustless Smart Oracles. The architecture is implemented on Ethereum ledger (testnet) and three trust management scenarios are used for illustration.

In the literature, existing architectures for permission delegation and access control are either event-based or query-based. These previous works assume a single trusted delegation service, which however is likely biased or fails to service. Also, they fail to allow users to verify delegation service operations, as such cannot be directly applied to IoT (Internet of Things) due to low power, low-bandwidth, ad-hoc and decentralized nature. This paper proposes a novel decentralized architecture for permission delegation and access control for IoT application, with demands on event and query base permission delegation. We further apply Blockchain (BC) technology to make delegation services secure, trusted, verifiable and decentralized. We investigate our proposed approach in Simple PROMELA INterpreter (SPIN) model checker using PROMELA (Process Meta Language).

R.	2019	Smart contract-based approach for efficient shipment management		Computers and Industrial Engineering														Smart contract-based approach for efficient shipment management																Hasan:2019:1	Blockchain//Ethereum//Internet of things//IoT//Smart contracts//Supply chain management	"Efficient tracking of shipments is critical in managing global trade and logistics activities. The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain.

The majority of these applications use centralized infrastructures something that poses several challenges especially related to trust and data security. Recently, blockchain has been introduced as an effective solution to IoT applications trying to provide solutions to these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized IoT application using blockchain technology, namely, ParkChain. The ParkChain application operates in a way that no one can delete, revert, hack or question the time a registered vehicle securely entered a parking area. In order to evaluate ParkChain, we have implemented the smart contract on top of Ethereum Blockchain along with a traditional Image Processing / Computer Vision approach for License Plate Recognition, and using a Raspberry Pi we control the access on a parking place.

However, there are many challenges in ensuring integrity, security, and fairness in the data sharing process.

However, the increasing number of devices also raises security concerns. The prevalence of Botnet of Things (BoT) has been observed and it has been recently reported that the launched attacks affect multiple domains and have caused unacceptable losses. As majority of IoT devices are manufactured off-shore, ensuring their identity becomes one of the major challenges. Cloned devices, with backdoors for malicious purposes, can provide an undue advantage of the adversary to compromise a system even though proper security measures are in place. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based framework to provide traceability of hardware. A unique identity for every IoT device is ensured using a physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides the verification of these devices by comparing these unique IDs.

Misbehaving routers affect the availability of the networks by dropping packets selectively and rejecting data forwarding services. Although existing Reputation Management (RM) systems are useful in identifying misbehaving routers, the centralized nature of the RM center has the risk of one-point failure. The emerging blockchain techniques, with the inherent decentralized consensus mechanism, provide a promising method to reduce this one-point failure risk. By adopting the distributed consensus mechanism, we propose a blockchain-based reputation management system in IoT networks to overcome the limitation of centralized router RM systems. The proposed solution utilizes the blockchain technique as a decentralized database to store router reports for calculating reputation of each router. With the proposed reputation calculation mechanism, the reliability of each router would be evaluated, and the malicious misbehaving routers with low reputations will be blacklisted and get isolated. More importantly, we develop an optimized group mining process for blockchain technique in order to improve the efficiency of block generation and reduce the resource consumption. The simulation results validate the distributed blockchain-based RM system in terms of attacks detection and system convergence performance, and the comparison result of the proposed group mining process with existing blockchain models illustrates the applicability and feasibility of the proposed works. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070290028&doi=10.1109%2fICCW.2019.8757083&partnerID=40&md5=45cdcf4bedd13e8f14a7bf1eec4e0648//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8757083/	internal-pdf://1911165193/08757083.pdf

However, most of these IoT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software update protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism while protects the privacy of involved users. A vendor delivers the updates and makes a commitment by using smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to its IoT devices. A transmission node can get financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. In order to obtain the proof-of-delivery, the transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out fair exchange. Specifically, the transmission node uses the DAPS to exchange an attribute-based signature (ABS) of one IoT device. Then, it uses the ABS as proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, to generate an ABS, the IoT device has to execute complex computations which is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to overcome the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067258270&doi=10.1016%2fj.jpdc.2019.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=d2d6d0440abf771ebd5118d2deee0d4f//https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272438/1-s2.0-S0743731519X00076/1-s2.0-S074373151930098X/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEGIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIC%2BGhX7YAdD9NIgbkHDbLU5vlM3rdF9mkH%2FJZMXStTC6AiAEOR80v7rgc%2Fnm6XzDU6rmPDJgMP7FrkNYh%2BhWkpEgtyq9Awj7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAMaDDA1OTAwMzU0Njg2NSIMWcc5Q0hehJqxhtJ8KpEDczDh63E6Mt3fVEHTSpaNoZJo%2BI9zk5IUy%2BaBUi4nA3fQAhSXJCEbNX%2BHpdazzRJtJjeWPTyLHX7ai7XEJRLMjcehlt806LRHBoUasWebiTXd%2BqogJ%2F6dEdeQJUhrYAdhB28%2BnC5JY4eH4Q6vBTVQblNgG5Y5KDtUd74ZfyehsFfi1mXkWFrOc22qtfwWzJhYiCgA0xcwu3uKNd5ctEQLRGjcTarjqUkHCT795iGyUQ6WUMNmA52LwyZ6hFC6aK4j1ElBbe8WnVOVWrLbb2IIW%2BaWGru1TGiBa5kaUR2UoeFA7KpViK7Lnc5a2qQd%2FJ2pVT0OvxSy0xoRteIfKv%2FdEQJFiLW4we0X7DCJErgsV9j8FlE9oAKWq5wHtPvtC5fN6p3uY5SksKe9IuKV7k7KhmqGXxMl%2FI6UHjkfoYz5epgHNMBsnSrwY%2BMxVsKRKXpQE97paDEetvB7CsRcWoAprx2yG4pubnlOQ5YVCH8x0DHduBJns5vFKRWRlXgfMjeHMVx6EpxLA7CTxa8r%2FyXMKhwws%2FGZ%2BAU67AGQeK9OuO2FEq%2BDWGJz8r%2FxJChXsLeuaqTV6h1uCCmsocT3%2BbJE7paE38fPHGdHQsGYkcQ0hmY45cX0wQtOb4XozXj9yYMLgN5MSxCVfz5J8i2AHGLYgXDpt8CeyIl00Jhp2geBZb94bosh53iPouZ7gxpSMreBokyNH%2B3ljqeFrvyDEurCHH9oqX4gYK5FkAVz1egUUdJJrTwn%2FWqg9BNECJNrP0h8aSsetNemn60rn2C9tBY1fR2TKXrAPtwrM09Irxd5YtKk%2F5N%2FT9peaRgofBpPOkSYk68R8vP8kSdkJM5IdMKUUb3h5RIN1w%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200709T024757Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY2PGAZJFX%2F20200709%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=770cd5f51e6bd779462a28c1dc98810287c497b97886e5b9cc30a5bcff94bd0f&hash=07b42440b7a31a8ebebd7f3982eaf3e6eb041b489a1870617114903980e5053f&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S074373151930098X&tid=spdf-ff91f6b6-1842-4c2a-ab37-06c496dea270&sid=61b602e14859f84f0679e431df325b728027gxrqa&type=client	internal-pdf://0945117276/Y-2019-Blockchain based privacy-preserving sof.pdf

However, malicious nodes located in an IoT network can influence clock synchronization. The security issues of time transfer and consistency are critical and challenging. In this paper, we propose a secure scheme based on blockchain to solve the problem of time synchronization in IoT. In the distributed network of IoT, a blockchain is utilized to record and broadcast time in order to reduce attacks from external environments with the property of passing trust. Moreover, this scheme has the advantage of low-latency by employing a consensus mechanism based on Proof of Stability.

Our framework accounts for key challenges of D2D-ECN in terms of the efficiency of the resource management and the resulting security concerns caused by lacking trustworthy between task owners and resource providers. In particular, we propose to use a blockchain-empowered framework for implementing resource trading and task assigment as the smart contracts. However, the existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) is impractical for the resource-constrained IoT devices due to high computational complexity of the mining process. Thus, we present a reputation-based consensus mechanism called proof-of-reputation (PoR), where the device with the highest reputation score is responsible for packaging the resource transactions and reputation records in the blockchain. Furthermore, we evaluate the reputation score of each device according to the current computation performance and history reputation. Security, feasibility analysis and numerical results show that our proposed computation offloading scheme can be deployed in the decentralized D2D-ECN system safely and effectively. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070188650&doi=10.1109%2fICC.2019.8761664&partnerID=40&md5=542a534097712e126bb877bb9cf4d4b9//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8761664/	internal-pdf://0631704565/08761664.pdf

Furthermore, our contribution includes the integration of digital signature for the IoT device authentication, the One Time Passcode with QR code for HSP staff access control, and IPFS for manipulating emergency call from SHS in peers. Our implementation results focusing on HSP miners will be presented and analysed. © 2019 IEEE."			https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068013694&doi=10.1109%2fPERCOMW.2019.8730816&partnerID=40&md5=de315909c741169dbb2252f36edf6e7f//https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730816/	internal-pdf://3692101153/08730816.pdf
