While global LPWANs typically require roaming agreements between network providers and a trusted third party for server resolution, we propose a trustless model where the network servers are resolved using a blockchain application. Since LoRaWAN relies on symmetric cryptography, we also propose a new security model that adds non-repudiation using digital signatures. This paves the way for linking devices to decentralized applications. We finally analyze the impact of this new model on message size and energy requirements. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","blockchain; distributed systems; Internet of Things; LoRaWAN","Authentication; Blockchain; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Network security; Distributed systems; Energy requirements; Internet of thing (IOT); LoRaWAN; Network provider; Non repudiation; Symmetric cryptography; Trusted third parties; Wide area networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066912156

Although there are stipulated standards to govern supply chain social sustainability, it is not uncommon to hear of businesses being reported for noncompliance issues. Even reputable firms such as Unilever have been criticized for production labor exploitation. Consumers now increasingly expect sellers to disclose information on social sustainability, but sellers are confronted with the challenge of traceability in their multi-tier global supply chains. Blockchain offers a promising future to achieve instant traceability in supply chain social sustainability. This study develops a system architecture that integrates the use of blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT) and big data analytics to allow sellers to monitor their supply chain social sustainability efficiently and effectively.

This paper illustrates the needs and requirements for managing supply chains in multi-company project environments by adopting various tracking and tracing technologies. This kind of tracking and tracing is especially needed within distributed architectures engaged in project-based businesses, where several vendors are involved in a single project. Such tracking and tracing data can be used extensively to generate key performance indicators, which can be used to measure and control supply chain processes. This paper also proposes a pilot system of a cloud-based portal for real-time tracking and tracing of logistics and supply chains. This portal is formed by the combination of RFID, IoT and blockchain technology into an integrated real-time view. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and IoT (Internet of Things) provides real-time information or data, while blockchain technology is used to provide a chain of immutable transactions. The architecture of the proposed portal system is connected to transport companies, tracking devices, consolidation points and suppliers. The pilot study also illustrates the benefits and advantages of such a portal system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Key performance indicators; Real-time; Supply chain management","Benchmarking; Blockchain; Internet of things; Supply chain management; Distributed architecture; Key performance indicators; Measure and controls; Real time; Real time supply chain; Real-time information; Supply chain process; Tracking and tracing; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075777905

One of the major attacking channels is utilizing the firmware of IoT devices as the access interface to compromise the targeted IoT devices. Therefore, it is important for IoT device manufacturers to support secure and efficient firmware update functionality for sold or deployed IoT devices. In this paper, a secure and verifiable blockchain-based firmware update framework for IoT environment is proposed. The aims of the proposed framework are providing secure peer-to-peer verification mechanism on each new version of firmware released by corresponding device manufacturer and providing a reliable way to distribute the updated firmware to IoT devices in timely manner. Furthermore, the utilization of blockchain technology in the proposed framework ensures the integrity of firmware during its distribution through Internet. The proposed firmware update framework consists of four processes: creation of firmware update contract, creation of third-party firmware update contract, PUSH update mechanism and PULL update mechanism. Six corresponding protocols are derived to support the four processes. The evaluation on performance and security strength of the proposed firmware update framework is conducted. Based on the proofs of formal security analysis, the proposed framework supports mutual authentication and defends against major cyber attacks: firmware modification attack, impersonation attack, man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; ECDH; Firmware update; Internet of Things; Smart contract","Blockchain; Firmware; Manufacture; Network security; ECDH; Firmware updates; Formal security analysis; Impersonation attack; Man in the middle attacks; Modification attack; Mutual authentication; Security strengths; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073963590

Conventionally, PLM is implemented based on standalone and centralized systems provided by software vendors. The information of PLM is hardly to be integrated and shared among the cooperating parties. It is difficult to meet the requirements of the openness, interoperability and decentralization of the Industry 4.0 era. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an industrial blockchain-based PLM framework to facilitate the data exchange and service sharing in the product lifecycle. Firstly, we proposed the concept of industrial blockchain as the use of blockchain technology in the industry with the integration of IoT, M2M, and efficient consensus algorithms. It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0. Secondly, we proposed and developed customized blockchain information service to fulfill the connection between a single node with the blockchain network. As a middleware, it can not only process the multi-source and heterogeneous data from varied stages in the product lifecycle, but also broadcast the processed data to the blockchain network. Moreover, smart contract is used to automate the alert services in the product lifecycles. Finally, we illustrated the blockchain-based application between the cooperating partners in four emerging product lifecycle stages, including co-design and co-creation, quick and accurate tracking and tracing, proactive maintenance, and regulated recycling. A simulation experiment demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is scalable and efficient, and hence it is feasible to be adopted in industry. With the successful development of the proposed platform, it is promising to provide an effective PLM for improving interoperability and cooperation between stakeholders in the entire product lifecycle. © 2019","Industrial blockchain; Industry 4.0; Product lifecycle management; Smart contract","Blockchain; Competition; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Industry 4.0; Information services; Interoperability; Middleware; Product design; Centralized systems; Consensus algorithms; Cooperating parties; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Multiple stakeholders; Proactive maintenance; Product life cycle management; Product life cycles; Life cycle",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075262668

Further, due to poll violence and waiting in the long queues to cast their votes, numbers of common citizens avoid the voting process completely in order to evade the chaos. In order to reduce these issues or to increase the voting rate, number of smart based or IoT enabled voting applications has been projected by various authors. However, IoT devices can be easily compromised or hacked by the experts (intruders) in order to gain their own access. Therefore, to ensure an enhanced secure and transparent polling process, Blockchain plays a vital role in ensuring the legit votes and their counting without their manipulation in any way. It is also needed in today’s times where the world is available to people in their IoT or smart devices to also give them the opportunity to register their votes hassle free via their smart devices without having to worry about the system getting hacked. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed layout will be based on an enhanced security through Blockchain in E-voting application using IoT devices where the user will create an account with proper verification done via voter id and other biometric methods on a smart device. Every transaction done via this account which in this case will be registering vote will be validated by a miner.

Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less “digital twins” for industrial IOT applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Ethereum; Industrial IOT; Industry 4.0; Smart contract; Supply chain","Blockchain; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Ethereum; Industry 4.0; Supply chains; Distributed data; Industrial datum; Industrial IOT; Internet of Things (IOT); IOT applications; Proof of concept; Storage technology; System capabilities; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076705255

The use of multimedia technique in healthcare system also makes it possible to store, process and transfer the patient’s data presented in variety of forms such as images, text and audio through online using various smart objects. Healthcare organizations around the world are transforming themselves into more efficient, coordinated and user-centered systems through various multimedia techniques. However, the management of huge amount data such as reports and images of every person leads to increase the human efforts and security risks. In order to overcome these issues, IoT in healthcare enhances the quality of patients care and reduce the cost by allocating the medical resources in an efficient way. However, a number of threats can occur in IoT devices initiated by various intruders. Sometimes, in order to make their personal profit, even though the medical shop or pathology labs are not of good reputation, the doctors forced the patients to do the lab tests, or buy the medicines from those organizations only. Therefore, security should be at the staple of outlook in IoT elucidations. In order to prevent these issues, Blockchain technology has been encountered as the best technique that provides the secrecy and protection of control system in real time conditions.

In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed ledger technologies; Edge computing; Internet of things; Livestock monitoring; Precision agriculture; Smart farming","Agriculture; Computer architecture; Edge computing; International trade; Precision agriculture; Quality of service; Sustainable development; Agri-food industry; Application of iot; Computing architecture; Environment friendly; Internet of thing (IOT); Resource monitoring; Resource-efficient; Smart farming; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076174369

These applications will typically rely on large numbers of IoT devices to collect and collaboratively process streamed data to enable real-time decision making. In this article, we introduce the concept of Semantic Virtual Space (SVS), an abstraction for virtualized cloud-enabled IoT infrastructure that is commensurate with the goals and needs of these emerging smart city applications, and propose and discuss scalable architectures and mechanisms that enable and automate the deployment and management of multiple SVS instances on top of the cloud-enabled IoT infrastructure. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Behavioral research; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Emergency traffic control; Interactive computer systems; Network security; Real time systems; Risk management; Security systems; Semantics; Smart city; Emergency management; Increased safety; Internet services; Real time decision-making; Real time videos; Scalable architectures; Situation awareness; Virtual spaces; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074500946

Blockchain-based IoT allows service providers to transfer the security and maintenance responsibility to self-maintaining customers. Adopting peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and computing for more than billions of transactions can reduce the costs arising from the installation and maintenance of centralized systems. Small manufacturers providing industrial IoT (IIoT) services can participate more actively in blockchain-based IIoT applications with three-dimensional printing and digital manufacturing technologies, but the measure to maintain privacy on a blockchain is not robust. Here, we propose a P2P networking-based custom manufacturing service, which is an order-driven trading service between a manufacturer and a customer in the blockchain-based IIoT architecture. The proposed system consists of reputation management and service architecture. We propose a new reputation assessment method customized to increase the reliability and accuracy of industrial manufacturing systems. We also propose a manufacturer rating classification to guide the customers’ decision making in a reliable manner and a malicious evaluator identification to exclude feedbacks from malicious evaluators. The proposed service architecture is composed of trustless P2P protocols designed for preserving privacy and providing non-repudiation. We used a cryptographic algorithm for ensuring transaction privacy and the digital signing of blockchain for non-repudiation. We also analyzed the proposed service architecture and the possible attack scenarios to verify the security requirements. We verified that the reputation management system was influenced by each feedback dynamically and guided the customer’s present decision making with reliable and classified manners, by simulating reputation classification and malicious evaluator identification. Further, we have summarized the originality and the characteristics of the proposed approach by comparing closely related studies and concluded with a future research guide. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Custom manufacturing; Peer to peer networking; Reputation; Trustless","3D printers; Blockchain; Cryptography; Decision making; Internet of things; Network architecture; Sales; Cryptographic algorithms; Custom manufacturing; Decentralized consensus; Industrial manufacturing; Peer-to-peer networking; Reputation; Reputation assessments; Trustless; Peer to peer networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065744826

However, a neural network’s over-fitting problem and rising computational costs associated with high levels of time complexity are obstacles to deep learning computations. Because of these problems, response delays are prevalent in big data learning processes and data extraction processes that use deep neural networks, which exponentially increase the cost of data extraction. Therefore, the amount of computation must be controlled so that data processing models can be used practically, and various dedicated devices can be used to process big data, including methods such as distributed processing methods. In general, a P2P method is a typical distributed processing method. P2P is based on traffic distribution and cooperation, and edge computing is a method that increases efficiency by locally processing large volumes of data produced and only transmitting essential information. If P2P method-based edge computing techniques are used, an effective parallel processing model can be constructed, reducing the computing requirements of a central server and the load of a network. In this paper, we propose an edge computing health model using P2P-based deep neural networks. The proposed method is used to process health big data in edge computing. To construct the model, multiple edge nodes are required, and the edge node modules are deployed at locations where health data are produced and directly connected to the deep neural network model. At the edge nodes, a modularized deep neural network is constructed, thereby implementing a parallel big data processing system. In addition, a single server is required for gathering the results of a neural network model, and because the server only collects evaluation results and provides them to the users, the response time delay is improved. In this paper, to evaluate an improved response time, a regular server model and an edge computing health model are constructed separately, and positive numerical values are extracted from the experiments. The extraction results confirm that a combination of parallel processing models and deep neural network techniques can be used to distribute and process computing operations of big data size, ensuring an effective system for reducing response time delay. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Data mining; Deep neural network; Edge computing; Hybrid P2P networking","Big data; Blockchain; Data handling; Data mining; Edge computing; Extraction; Health; Learning algorithms; Peer to peer networks; Response time (computer systems); Time delay; Data processing models; Data processing systems; Distributed processing; Hybrid P2P; Neural network learning algorithm; Neural network techniques; Parallel processing models; Traffic distributions; Deep neural networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064602441

At present, because IIoT system is an open, distributed and heterogeneous system, it is a great challenge to implement trusted communication in IIoT. Blockchain technology has become a new way to solve the cooperative trust issues of industrial Internet of Things. Using blockchain, a tamper-proof system can be built, which can be used as an audit tool for hardware products of industrial Internet of Things from chip to whole equipment. Blockchain improve productivity and operational efficiency of IIoT through smart contract, allowing machines to manage themselves. To apply blockchain technology in IIoT, one of the main issues is to solve the security and efficiency problems of consensus protocols. In this paper, a reputation scheme is proposed to encourage normal nodes and abnormal nodes both to participate in network collaboration in a good way. In order to guide the behavior, a credit based incentive approach is proposed. The reward and punishment factor is designed in the revenue payment function of reputation. The effectiveness is that the cooperative behavior is rewarded, and the non cooperative behavior is punished. The main advantage of our scheme is that our reputation based incentive module can be implemented on state-of-the-art PoX protocols, which is called PoRX,and can make PoX protocols achieve better consensus states. Therefore, it would benefit the applications of IIoT with blockchain. A prototype has been implemented and the experimental results shows that our scheme can effectively encourage the cooperative behavior of the nodes in IIoT, that can benefit the network. © 2019","Blockchain; IIoT; PoX; Trust management","Automobile parts and equipment; Behavioral research; Efficiency; Internet of things; Productivity; Trusted computing; Co-operative behaviors; IIoT; Industrial production; Non-cooperative behaviors; Operational efficiencies; Reputation based incentives; Trust management; Trusted communications; Blockchain",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070398131

By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions.

At the same time, BC has high computation complexity, restricted scalability, high bandwidth overhead and latency that is unsuitable to IoT. In this paper, efficient Lightweight integrated Blockchain (ELIB) model is developed to meet necessitates of IoT. The presented model is deployed in a smart home environment as an important illustration to verify its applicability in various IoT scenarios. The resource constrained resources in a smart home takes the advantages from a centralized manager which generates shared keys to transmit data, process every incoming and outgoing requests. The presented ELIB model generates an overlay network where highly equipped resources can merges to a public BC which verifies dedicated security and privacy. A set of three optimizations are carried out in the presented ELIB model include lightweight consensus algorithm, certificateless (CC) cryptography and Distributed Throughput Management (DTM) scheme. A detailed simulation takes place under different scenarios in terms of processing time, energy usage and overhead. The ELIB attains a total of 50% saving in processing time on comparing to baseline method with the minimum energy consumption of 0.07mJ.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; EU GDPR Compliance; Internet of Things; Security and privacy; Smart city","Access control; Application programming interfaces (API); Blockchain; Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Network security; Smart city; Supply chain management; Centralized control; General data protection regulations; Industrial control systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Single channels; Various Channels; Data privacy",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074150487

IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text.

However, this conventional cloud-based data sharing environment has data security and privacy issues. This paper proposes a distributed solution based on blockchain technology for trusted Health Information Exchange (HIE). In addition to exchange of EHR between patient and doctor, the proposed system is also used in other aspects of healthcare such as improving the insurance claim and making data available for research organizations. Medical data is very sensitive, in both social as well as legal aspects, so permissioned block-chain such as Hyperledger Fabric is used to retain the necessary privacy required in the proposed system. As, this is highly permissioned network where the owner of the network i.e. patient holds all the access rights, so in case of emergency situations the proposed system has a Backup Access System which will allow healthcare professionals to access partial EHR and this backup access is provided by using wearable IOT device.

Using Internet of Things (IoT) to mine makes blockchain more ubiquitous and decentralized, which has become a main development trend of blockchain. However, the limited resources of existing IoT cannot satisfy the high requirements of on-demand energy consumption in the mining process through a decentralized way. To address this, we propose a decentralized on-demand energy supply approach based on microgrids to provide decentralized on-demand energy for mining in IoT devices. First, energy supply architecture is proposed to satisfy different energy demands of miners in response to different consensus protocols. Then, we formulate the energy allocation as a Stackelberg game and adapt backward induction to achieve an optimal profit strategy for both microgrids and miners in IoT. The simulation results show the fairness and incentive of the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; energy supply; Internet of Things (IoT); microgrids; next generation society","Blockchain; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Miners; Network architecture; Consensus protocols; Development trends; Energy allocations; Energy supplies; Internet of Things (IOT); Micro grid; next generation society; Trust and security; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068142731

The traditional mechanisms for QoS measurements rely on the centralized trusted third parties who use specialized agents to collect data and measure the performances of services. However, these mechanisms are ineffective to deal with highly dynamic and distributed nature of IoT-based services. Moreover, the dynamism of QoS needs to collect, update, and access reliable quality relevant data frequently, while lacking trust becomes a major hurdle for data utilization. It is our argument that the QoS measurement of IoT-based services would be decentralized and the trusts be built from collectively trusted subnetworks.

Data are one of the most important commodities in IoT. To maximize the utility of the collected data, it is crucial to design an open IoT data market that enables data owners and consumers to carry out data trading securely and efficiently. To address the challenge of security presented by an untrusted and nontransparent data market, we propose an edge/cloud-computing-assisted, blockchain-enhanced data market framework to support secure and efficient IoT data trading, with a particular focus on an optimal pricing mechanism. In this mechanism, an authorized market-agency works as a scheduler, determining the win-owner and its pricing strategy to the consumer. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to solve the pricing and purchasing problem of the data consumer and the market-agency. In the first stage of the game, the market-agency gives the win-owner and its pricing strategy. In the second stage, the data consumer decides on its purchasing quantity of data. We consider competition between data owners and propose a competition-enhanced pricing scheme (CPS). We apply backward induction to analyze the subgame perfect equilibrium at each stage for both independent and CPSs. Lastly, we validate the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium, and the numerical results show the efficiency of the CPS. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; data market; Internet of Things (IoT); smart pricing mechanism; Stackelberg game","Blockchain; Commerce; Costs; Backward induction; Existence and uniqueness; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Numerical results; Smart pricing; Stackelberg equilibrium; Stackelberg Games; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076719784

Optimizing system performance is becoming a great challenge for an ever-increasing large-scale distributed application system in the digital economy on the Internet of Things (IoT) era. In a centralized BPM, many indicators, such as security and openness, or cost and flexibility, are conflicting with each other. For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems. BCT has to be integrated with other BPM system components that often involve IoT devices to implement specified functionalities related to the application.

Resulting from these salient features, blockchain has been applied in multiple non-monetary applications including the Internet of Things (IoT). However, blockchain is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited for most IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Scalable blockchain (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements while also providing end-to-end security. Our blockchain instantiation achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage the blockchain. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public blockchain. We propose a Distributed Time-based Consensus algorithm (DTC) which reduces the mining processing overhead and delay. Distributed trust approach is employed by the cluster heads to progressively reduce the processing overhead for verifying new blocks. LSB incorporates a Distributed Throughput Management (DTM) algorithm which ensures that the blockchain throughput does not significantly deviate from the cumulative transaction load in the network. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that our approach is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that packet overhead and delay are decreased and blockchain scalability is increased compared to relevant baselines. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain; Internet of Things; Security; Smart home","Automation; Blockchain; Cost reduction; Scalability; Temperature control; Bandwidth overheads; Consensus algorithms; End-to-end security; Extensive simulations; Internet of thing (IOT); Processing overhead; Security; Smart homes; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072261125

However, the 'trust tax' imposed on manufacturers during their countless collaborations with customers, suppliers, distributors, governments, service providers, and other manufacturers is very high. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can lead to more transparent, secure, and efficient transactions. It represents a new paradigm, as well as new thinking, of how data can be securely stored, integrated, and communicated among different stakeholders, organizations, and systems that unnecessarily trust each other. Blockchain is greatly useful for reducing the 'trust tax,' especially beneficial for the small- and medium-sized enterprises that must tolerate much heavier trust tax than the established manufacturers. This paper investigates the blockchain-based security and trust mechanism and elaborates a particular application of blockchain for quality assurance, which is one of the strategic priorities of smart manufacturing.

IoT is envisioned as a global network infrastructure consisting of numerous connected devices over the Internet. Many attempts have been made to improve and adapt business workflows for best utilizing IoT services. One possible solution is to digitize and automate internal processes using IoT services, in which Blockchain smart contract is a viable solution to establish the trust of process executions without intermediaries. Modern business processes are composed of disparate services; many of them tend to be delivered based on IoT. Interoperating with such services poses major challenges: 1) time for finality settlement of transactions is unpredictable and usually experiencing delay; 2) several implementations of permissioned Blockchain pose a major concern of trust regarding nodes that perform consensus; and 3) trust of process executions and IoT information is the major factor to the success of modern business processes, which require the composition of distributed IoT services. Traditional business processes are mostly managed by a single entity, which induces the problem of trust of process executions. In this paper, a smart contract for establishing the trust of process executions that fits into the IoT environment is presented.

The aforementioned features make fog computing an extremely suitable interface between the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud. Despite implementation, design, modeling, computing, communication, and several architectural challenges, performance and energy aware Fog–IoT computing has not attained significant attention by the researchers lately. To that end, this paper encompasses the concept of green renewable energy in the fog environment. In order to effectively add authentication as well as security layer to this sensitive data, blockchain presents a ideal solution for securing a centralized ledger of the utilization data. Blockchain technology being easy to deploy and having cross platform nature becomes an ideal candidate for leveraging the full potential of the system. This paper proposes an adaptive performance and energy-aware scheme for Fog–IoT computational environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, simulations are configured through iFogSim simulator and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art methodology.

With the advancement in technologies, the use of IoTs devices also increases. However, security risks regarding service provisioning and data sharing also increases. There are many existing security approaches. However, these approaches are not suitable for IoTs devices due to their limited storage and computation resources. These secure approaches also require a specific hardware. With the invention of blockchain technologies, many security risks are eliminated. Blockchain also supports data sharing mechanism. In this paper, we proposed a secure service providing mechanism for IoTs using blockchain. We introduced cloud nodes for maintaining the validity states of edge service providers. The edge node reputation is considered as a service rating given by end users. Incentive is given to edge servers after validation of service codes. Incentive is in the form of cryptocurrency. Incentive and edge node reputation values are stored in cloud node and are updated with respect to time. Smart contract is proposed to check the validity state of the edge servers. Smart contract is also used for the comparison and verification of the service codes provided by edge servers. In our proposed system, we perform service authentication at both cloud and edge server layer. Moreover, Proof of Authority (PoA) is used as a consensus mechanism. PoA enhanced overall performance of our proposed system. By experimental analysis, it is shown that our proposed model is suitable for resource constrained devices. © 2019 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Fog Computing; Internet of Things; Light Weight Clients; Proof of Authority; Proof of Work","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Fog computing; Internet of things; Internet service providers; Computation resources; Experimental analysis; Internet of thing (IoTs); Light weight; Proof of Authority; Proof of work; Resourceconstrained devices; Service authentication; Data Sharing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074703415

The traditional access control protocols are not suitable for IoT mainly due to a massive scale, ubiquitous connectivity and distributed nature. Blockchain based access control approaches provide decentralized security but they involve scalability problem, high transaction fees, a significant delay, and computational overhead that is not acceptable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, data published on the blockchain are public which is not ideal for many scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a new decentralized access control system based on the Tangle which empowers the users to dictate the access to their resource. In our proposed decentralized access control model the policies and access rights are published on the Tangle which guarantees distributed auditability and prevents the user from fraudulently denying the granted access rights. The main contribution of the paper is to provide privacy of the policy by leveraging Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) data communication protocol. The proposed work is validated by implementation and is tested with AVISPA tool which confirms security in the presence of the intruder. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ABAC; Access control; Blockchain; Internet of things; IOTA; Tangle","Blockchain; Control systems; Internet of things; ABAC; Access control protocol; Computational overheads; Data communication protocols; Decentralized access control; IOTA; Security and privacy; Tangle; Access control",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068117745

It builds a reliable architecture for decentralized control through multi-node information redundancy. Based on this, this paper proposes lightweight IoT information sharing security framework based on blockchain technology. The framework adopts a double-chain model combining data blockchain and transaction blockchain: distributed storage and tamper-proof of data in the data blockchain, and improved by the improved practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (PBFT) mechanism consensus algorithm. Data registration efficiency; resource and data transactions in the transaction blockchain is improved transaction efficiency and privacy protection through improved algorithms based on partial blind signature algorithms. A dynamic game method of node cooperation is proposed to prevent malicious behavior of local dominance. The state of the unknown node is estimated by reporting the node's institutional reputation value; the high-trust reference report is used to correct the weight of the malicious node in the overall report and node merging, and finally reach the Bayesian equilibrium. Finally, the simulation experiment department carried out verification analysis on the anti-attack capability, double-strand processing capability and delay.

Many data owners (DOs) outsource their data to cloud repositories due to several economic advantages cloud service providers present. However, DOs, after their data are outsourced, do not have complete control of the data, and therefore, external systems are incorporated to manage the data. Several kinds of research refer to the use of encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access to data but prove to be deficient in providing suitable solutions to the problem. In this article, we propose a secure fine-grain access control system for outsourced data, which supports read and write operations to the data. We make use of an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which is regarded as a suitable scheme to achieve access control for security and privacy (confidentiality) of outsourced data. This article considers different categories of data users, and make provisions for distinct access roles and permissible actions on the outsourced data with dynamic and efficient policy updates to the corresponding ciphertext in cloud repositories. We adopt blockchain technologies to enhance traceability and visibility to enable control over outsourced data by a DO. The security analysis presented demonstrates that the security properties of the system are not compromised. Results based on extensive experiments illustrate the efficiency and scalability of our system. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; fine-grained access control; key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE); smart contract","Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Information management; Attribute-based encryptions; Cloud service providers; Economic advantages; Encryption technique; Fine grained; Security and privacy; Security properties; Unauthorized access; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076792116

Vulnerabilities in those systems arise from poor physical security, unauthenticated devices, insecure firmware updates, insecure communication, and data corruption. In recent times Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), of which Blockchain is an instance, have been identified as a possible solution to some of these issues. The blokchain model genetically ensures decentralized security and privacy, and therefore could provide IoT systems with a trusted infrastructure for securely logging data or exchanging tokens without the necessity, and costs, of central servers. Blockchain is no panacea, either. IoT devices that get connected to a blockchain network must still be secured, in particular they must protect the confidentiality of the keys. This requires the embedded microcontroller to execute only authenticated firmware, with protections against software attacks, such as buffer overflows, and resistance against side-channel attacks. In addition, as confirmed from the scarcity of implementations reported in the literature, it is still not clear whether blockchain protocols can be implemented efficiently on resource-constrained IoT devices. In this work, also supported by a Demo, we show an example of secure IoT device that enables the functionalities of IOTA, a DLT specifically designed for the use in the IoT. In particular, we present a Light Node based on STM32 that implements all the cryptographic functions, IOTA specific operations and communication functions required to successfully publish transactions in the IOTA distributed ledger. Our implementations on microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M) performs up to 22 times faster in terms of cycles and up to 4 times faster in absolute time with respect to the state-of-The-Art implementation on a Raspberry PI 3B. Our Light Node also ensures protection of the stored private data and guarantees secure firmware update thanks to a suitable configuration of some security features provided by STM32 microcontrollers. © BlockSys 2019 - Proceedings of the 2019 Workshop on Blockchain-Enabled Networked Sensor Systems.

To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users’ selection in a ‘win–lose’ manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a ‘win–win’ manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical examples. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","blockchain; IoT and DCNN; Quantum-computing modelling","Blockchain; Cognitive radio; Communication channels (information theory); Computation theory; Data flow analysis; Deep neural networks; Fault tolerance; Game theory; Internet of things; MIMO systems; Neural networks; Pareto principle; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Computers and communications; Convolutional neural network; Hardware and software architectures; Internet of Things (IOT); IoT and DCNN; Multi input multi output; Quantum Computing; Resource allocation policy; Channel capacity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074900119

One of the major issues is to provide security to a number of different connected devices to the Internet, known as Internet of Things (IoT). A potential solution to this problem is the blockchain-based architecture. In addition, the complex nature of activities performed by humans in diverse healthcare environments reduces the qualitative measures for extracting distinct features representing various human actions. To answer this challenge, we propose an activity monitoring and recognition framework, which is based on multi-class cooperative categorization procedure to improve the activity classification accuracy in videos supporting the fog or cloud computing-based blockchain architecture. In the proposed approach, frame-based salient features are extracted from videos consisting of different human activities, which are further processed into action vocabulary for efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, the classification of activities is performed using support vector machine (SVM) based on the error-correction-output-codes (ECOC) framework.

CTN comprises a network of physical devices capable of extracting and sharing digital information. The aim of CTN is to develop smart appliances that boost productivity and provide real-time data rapidly than any structure or a network that is dependent on human interference. Interconnected physical objects in the network communicate with each other and facilitate intelligent decision-making by monitoring and analysing their surroundings. In today's era, CTNs are playing a significant role in daily activities by providing a substantial reduction in costs with increased visibility and efficiency in all aspects of businesses and individuals. In this manuscript, we have considered an important application of CTNs (i.e., IoT) and have proposed a secure Hybrid Industrial IoT framework using the Blockchain technique. We have used a hybrid industrial architecture where different branches of a company are located in more than one country. Although IoT devices are used in many organizations and assist in reducing their production costs along with improving quality, several threats can occur in IoT devices initiated by various intruders. Intruders may compromise IoT devices with the purpose of performing malicious activities. For example, a company's employee may steal some product or may rest during working hours. To prevent these issues, the Blockchain technology is considered as the best technique that provides secrecy and protects the control system in real-time conditions. In this manuscript, we have used a Blockchain mechanism to extract information from IoT devices and store extracted records into Blockchain to maintain transparency among various users located at different places. Furthermore, the experimentation of the proposed framework has been performed against the internal communication of Blockchain where IoT devices are compromised by several intruders. Results have been analysed against the conventional approach and validated with improved simulated results that offer an 89% success rate over user request time, falsification attack, black hole attack, and probabilistic authentication scenarios because of the Blockchain technology. © 2019","Blockchain security; Industrial IoT; IoT devices","Blockchain; Cost reduction; Decision making; Digital devices; Network security; Conventional approach; Industrial architecture; Industrial IoT; Intelligent decision making; Internal communications; IoT devices; Malicious activities; Substantial reduction; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068038790

The interconnectivity of the business world, health environments, smart home devices, and daily use gadgets takes place through the networks based on cloud infrastructure which is not restricted to jurisdictional, geographic, and national boundaries. However, the light-weight IoT devices come with a limited storage and processing capacity. Due to this limitation, the need for separate data storage arises so that data can be utilized in the future. These third-party storage services are provided at the cost of a user's privacy. Furthermore, the storage relies on a centralized database which is more open to attack due to its single point security breach chances. Furthermore, present IoT data is not trustworthy in the external environment, as data manipulation is lacking when data is shared with other parties. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations of IoT, the emerging secure decentralized storage technology; Blockchain, have begun to abandon the significant impact in the IoT with the enhancement of security and incorporating a large number of devices in the today's ecosystems. In this paper, we have performed a comprehensive literature review to show how well blockchain has transformed the smart environments connected with IoT sensors and the underlying issues for its adaptation. Further, a well-organized taxonomy is presented by highlighting the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of blockchain based IoT environment. In addition to that, we have clearly presented the verities of blockchain applications such as bitcoin (earlier cryptocurrency used in blockchain) or ethereum (establish smart contracts) based works and pinpoint the necessities and security challenges. Moreover, we have highlighted the essential implementation requirements of blockchain in the IoTs. This paper is also equipped with a state-of-the-art framework of IoT while adopting security features and decentralized storage requirements of the blockchain.

In order to address the security vulnerability of the existing system, in this paper a block chain based Smart Wireless Body Area Networks has been proposed to provide better security with enhanced privacy and access control for E-health care monitoring system. Moreover, the proposed system enhances the scalability and provides mitigation against all the security attacks in IoT Environment. ©BEIESP.","Block Chain; E-Health monitoring system; IoT; Security threats; Smart Wireless Body Area Networks",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075202554

In an IoT scenario, self-configured things are dynamically connected in a universal network. The small things are broadly distributed in a real world model with some essential processing capacity and finite storage. Security, privacy and reliability are the most important pillars of the IoT infrastructure. It is challenging to share personal data, highly confidential professional data over a centralized system. The infrastructure itself is capable to provide the guarantee to transmit data safely. However, a special attention for the data along with data consistency is required. Cyber attackers and hackers mostly target the centralized systems. To triumph over these types of situations we propose a security based blockchain service along with some encryption approaches for a secure communication. The encryption and decryption is performed by a hash based secret key. Risk modelling and relative risk reduction also done to prevent attacks under a virtual private network in IoT domain. Before and after attack users also wish to know quality of service (QoS). We have developed a mobile application framework which provides desire output of a user from different aspect of QoS for better understanding. The MQTT broker performs as a negotiator to convey data between cloud consumer and cloud provider. In QoS monitoring section user get chance to reconsider availability, reliability and responsibility like QoS factors while recovering resources and actual resources before attacking system based on CPU utilization, cache status and storage.

Tese devices possess low computational resources, and as a result they cannot use security tools such as antivirus or firewalls. Consequently, they become easy targets for cyberatacks and malware infection, thus puting a person's life at risk. One way to protect these devices from malware infection is Remote Atestation (RA), a process by which a device with low computational power (prover) verifies its internal state to a party with higher computational resources (verifier) upon the later's request. However, in case the verifier is malicious, it may constantly send numerous requests for RA to a prover to prevent it from performing the functions it was designed for. Tus, keeping it busy and rendering it unusable to its legit users as well as services. In short, the verifier performs a Computational Denial of Service (CDoS) atack against the prover. Tis paper proposes the BARRETT architecture which uses a Public Ethereum Network (PEN) in conjunction with an RA protocol to protect the prover from CDoS atacks. In particular, the PEN in BARRETT deters CDoS by forcing the verifier to pay a fee in Ether cryptocurrency every time they wish to send an Atestation Request (AR) to a prover. The verifier pays the fee since in BARRETT it can send the AR only via Ethereum transactions. Consequently, any atempt to perform a CDoS becomes prohibitively expensive. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Blockchain; Denial of service; DoS; Ethereum; Healthcare; Internet of Things; IoT; Remote attestation; Security","Blockchain; Computer viruses; Denial-of-service attack; DOS; Ethereum; Health care; Network architecture; Anti virus; Computational power; Computational resources; Denial of Service; Internal state; Remote attestation; Security; Security tools; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074359248

However, the computation offloading solutions for data processing tasks and for blockchain mining tasks have been studied separately. Moreover, most of the existing solutions for offloading assume that all IIoT devices can directly connect to the ESs or cloud data centers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multihop cooperative and distributed computation offloading algorithm that considers the data processing tasks and the mining tasks together for blockchain-empowered IIoT. First, we study the multihop computation offloading problem for both the data processing tasks and the mining tasks to minimize the economic cost of IIoT devices. Second, we formulate the offloading problem as a potential game in which the IIoT devices can make their decisions autonomously and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) for the game. Third, we design an efficient distributed algorithm based on exchanging messages between IIoT devices to achieve the NE with low computational complexity. Lastly, our experimental results demonstrate that our distributed algorithm scales well as the number of IIoT devices increases and has the minimum system cost compared with other approaches. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; computation offloading; edge computing; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)","Blockchain; Data handling; Edge computing; Internet of things; Cloud data centers; Computation offloading; Computing capability; Distributed computations; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Low computational complexity; Multi-hop cooperative; Offloading computations; Computational efficiency",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073470765

The Internet of Things (IoT) is progressing at a fast pace, and IoT devices are becoming pervasive in our physical environments, bringing the vision of Intelligent Environments closer to reality. At the same time, the newly-introduced blockchain technology is offering for the first time ever cryptographically proven trust based on a set of mutually untrusted nodes. Blockchain technology thus has the potential to become a key component of many IoT systems, offering them an unprecedented level of accountability, transparency, and reliability. This paper first lays out the principles on which blockchain systems are operating, along with descriptions of the most noteworthy blockchain implementations. It then presents a number of systems through which blockchains may interact with external systems and third-party data sources. Finally, it provides a survey of the state-of-the-art blockchain-based systems targeting IoT applications. © 2019 by the authors.","Blockchains; Distributed ledger technology (DLT); Internet of things (IoT)","Blockchain; Intelligent agents; Blockchains; Distributed ledger technology (DLT); Intelligent environment; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Physical environments; State of the art; Third party datum; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073785205

However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; dynamic key management; fine-grained access control; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy preserving; smart healthcare","Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Health care; Dynamic key managements; Fine grained; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Privacy preserving; Remote monitoring; Security analysis; Smart healthcare systems; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073422904

Recently, blockchain offers a promising solution to overcome the current peer-to-peer networks limitations. In the context of IoT, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)-based consensus protocols are used due to the energy efficiency advantage over other consensus protocols. The consensus process in BFT is done by electing a group of authenticated nodes. The elected nodes will be responsible for ensuring the data blocks' integrity through defining a total order on the blocks and preventing the concurrently appended blocks from containing conflicting data. However, the blockchain consensus layer contributes the most performance overhead. Therefore, a performance study needs to be conducted especially for the IoT applications that are subject to maximum delay constraints. In this paper, we obtain a mathematical expression to calculate the end-to-end delay with different network configurations, i.e., number of network hops and replica machines. We validate the proposed analytical model with simulation. Our results show that the unique characteristics of IoT traffic have an undeniable impact on the end-to-end delay requirement. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; Byzantine consensus; end-to-end delay; Internet of Things (IoT); queueing; realtime","Blockchain; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Fault tolerance; Peer to peer networks; Byzantine consensus; End to end delay; Internet of Things (IOT); queueing; Real time; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073418499

Most of IoT applications centralize security assurance in creating, authenticating, transferring, or delating system components. However, the centralization exposes its limitations to meet security needs of a rapidly growing number of things world-widely. How to scale up the applications with assured security becomes a critical challenge. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a promising solution to provide security and protect privacy in a large scale; especially, smart contracts offer opportunities to improve the reliability of IoT applications. Smart contracts establish trusts for both of data and executed processes. Recently, many literature surveys and positioning articles have been published on the integration of BCT with IoT, but they are limited to superficial discussions of technical potentials, and very few of them have a thorough exploration of the challenges in developing BCT for IoT at technical levels. This paper uses the system design approach to scrutinize the state of the art of study on BCT-based applications and clarify critical research areas of enabling BCT for security assurance: 1) the relations of BCT and IoT are modeled and discussed; 2) the needs of eliminating threats in IoT-based applications are defined as functional requirements (FRs), existing works on enabling technologies of BCT are defined as the physical solutions (PSs); and 3) the mappings between FRs and PSs are established to identify the limitations and the critical areas for the applications of BCT in large-scale distributed environment. © 2014 IEEE.","Axiomatic design theory (ADT); blockchain technologies (BCT); Internet of Things (IoT); literature review; security assurance; service-oriented architecture (SoA); smart contract","Blockchain; Information services; Mapping; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Systems analysis; Virtual reality; Axiomatic design theory; Distributed environments; Enabling technologies; Functional requirement; Internet of Things (IOT); Literature reviews; Security assurance; Technical potential; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073409047

Technology on the other hand is reaching out to meet some of the demands that the healthcare will continuously require in order to deliver their services on time. One such technology is known as the internet of things (IoT). IoT has already proven its great potential towards the healthcare domain. IoT has the ability to allow patients to be monitored from the comfort of their homes through sensors equipped within devices deployed to perform specific tasks. The other technology is none other than the Blockchain which was introduced to deliver its capabilities in the financial ledger.

However, the PoW consensus mechanism is computation-consuming which obstacles the application of PBN in wireless mobile networks since most Internet of Things/mobile devices (IMDs) are resource limited. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technology which can allow IMDs to offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes. Although IMDs can offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes, there is still lots of competition among enormous solo mining IMDs when reaching consensus. In this paper, we first formulate the computation resource allocation problem of PBN from the viewpoint of coalition game theory under the MEC environment. Then, we propose a coalition formation game-based algorithm to maximize the system sum utility and take both the individual profit of IMD and coalition profit into consideration. Furthermore, we prove the proposed algorithm converges to a Nash-stable partition in a fast convergence rate and finally reaches the near-optimal solution with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the optimality and convergence of the proposed algorithm, and the proposed algorithm outperforms other schemes in terms of system sum profit and ratio of rewarded IMDs to overall IMDs. © 2014 IEEE.","Coalition game; computation offloading; Internet of Things (IoT); mobile edge computing (MEC); public blockchain","Blockchain; Computer games; Edge computing; Internet of things; Profitability; Resource allocation; Wireless networks; Coalition formation games; Coalition game; Computation offloading; Computation resource allocations; Internet of Things (IOT); Low computational complexity; mobile edge computing (MEC); Wireless mobile networks; Game theory",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073415134

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; encrypted Internet of Things (IoT) data; homomorphic cryptosystem (HC); machine learning (ML); privacy protection","Anomaly detection; Blockchain; Computer aided diagnosis; Cryptography; Data privacy; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Smart city; Support vector machines; Data-sharing platforms; Homomorphic cryptosystem; Internet of Things (IOT); Polynomial multiplication; Privacy protection; Real-world scenario; Secure building blocks; Trusted third parties; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069186132

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain. The Smart contracts were implemented in Solidity language and tested using Remix IDE environment, the code has been made publicly available for academic, research and practice community. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Ethereum; Internet of things; IoT; Smart contracts; Supply chain management","Blockchain; Ethereum; Internet of things; Receivers (containers); Ships; Emerging technologies; Geographical locations; Internet of Things (IOT); Process complexity; Real time tracking; Sender and receivers; System functionality; Trusted third parties; Supply chain management",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068896995

Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time. © 2019","Blockchain; Deep learning; Edge computing; Fog computing; Internet of things; Security attack detection; Software defined networking","Blockchain; Computer architecture; Deep learning; Digital storage; Edge computing; Fog; Fog computing; Internet of things; Network architecture; Smart city; Software defined networking; Distributed architecture; Existing architectures; Experimental evaluation; Internet of thing (IOT); Proposed architectures; Security Architecture; Security attacks; Software defined networking (SDN); Network security",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068438381

However, most of these IoT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software update protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism while protects the privacy of involved users. A vendor delivers the updates and makes a commitment by using smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to its IoT devices. A transmission node can get financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. In order to obtain the proof-of-delivery, the transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out fair exchange. Specifically, the transmission node uses the DAPS to exchange an attribute-based signature (ABS) of one IoT device. Then, it uses the ABS as proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, to generate an ABS, the IoT device has to execute complex computations which is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to overcome the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Attribute-based signatures; Blockchain; IoT; Privacy-preserving; Software update","Blockchain; Data privacy; Finance; Network security; Attribute-based signatures; Complex computation; Financial incentives; Incentive mechanism; Privacy preserving; Resource-limited devices; Security weakness; Software updates; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067258270

NeoVM is a turing-complete computing machine, designed for Neo Blockchain, specially designed for cryptographic and deterministic (verifiable) computation. A NeoVM program is called a NVM Script (or just Script), and it is often used together with Neo Blockchain application capabilities, being called a Smart Contract. Smart Contracts are already used on other blockchains such as Bitcoin (although not Turing-complete) for value transfers, through the availability of verifiable information, i.e., transactions and transaction blocks, on a global ledger.

To alleviate the shortage in energy supply, an increasing number of renewable energy sources (RES) are being integrated into the main grid. However, the unpredictability and intermittency of energy generation in power systems may lead to unforeseen demand peaks. To address this issue, we propose two blockchain-based Local energy market (LEM) mechanisms that assist prosumers (i.e., users with RESs that can either produce or absorb energy) and consumers to trade energy securely, balance demand and supply in a decentralized approach, and sell surplus energy to the main grid. Specifically, this paper presents the concept of Proof of Energy Generation (PoEG) to increase energy production by rewarding a prosumer as a validator to add a block in the blockchain. Also, we propose the concept of Proof of Energy Consumption (PoEC) to incentivize a user to reduce energy consumption at peak hours. To validate the proposed mechanisms, we implement a blockchain-based transaction system that consists of five nodes, a wallet, and real price and consumption data from Ontario Electric Board. The results of our experiments show that prosumers could increase their probability to win as a validator with increased energy productions and decreased consumption. We simulate two case studies, and the results show that an increase of 20% generation increases wallet balance by 10% followed by PoEG algorithm while a reduction of 20% consumption increments the balance by 9% employing PoEC algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Consensus protocol; Local energy trading; Smart grid","Blockchain; Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Consensus protocols; Decentralized approach; Energy generations; Local energy; Reduce energy consumption; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Transaction systems; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076342243

The technical challenges of current VANET are decentralized architecture deployment and privacy protection. Since the blockchain owns the characteristics of being decentralized, distributed, collective maintenance and non-tampering, this paper designs a novel decentralized architecture using blockchain technology, which is called blockchain-based VANET. The blockchain-based VANET involves four major stages: blockchain set-up, registration of vehicles, SBMs upload, and blockchain record. It can effectively address the problems of centralization and mutual distrust between entities in current VANET. For protecting identity and location privacy, we propose UGG, IPP and LPP algorithms with the way of dynamic threshold encryption and k-anonymity unity in the stage of SBMs upload of blockchain-based VANET. To quantify the availability of k-anonymity unity, we propose two indicators: connectivity and average distance. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of blockchain-based VANET. We analyze the simulation results from four aspects: system time, average distance, connectivity, and privacy leakage. The simulation results show that our proposed architecture performs better in terms of processing time than current architectures. Furthermore, our proposed architecture shows its superior in the aspect of protecting identity and location privacy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Decentralized; Identity privacy; Location privacy; VANET","Blockchain; Cryptography; Location; Network architecture; Decentralized; Decentralized architecture; Extensive simulations; Location privacy; Location privacy protection; Proposed architectures; Technical challenges; VANET; Vehicular ad hoc networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069461401

Furthermore, distributed edge services can make resource transactions vulnerable to malicious nodes. Ensuring secure edge services under complex industrial networks is a big challenge. In this article, we present an edge intelligence and blockchain empowered IIoT framework, which achieves flexible and secure edge service management.

However, the occurrence of several massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in infected IoT devices has brought increased attention to the importance of IoT security. Since IoT devices are equipped only with lightweight operation systems, the installation of antivirus software cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, a method through which the firmware of IoT devices can be securely and autonomously updated must be developed. This paper proposes a blockchain-based firmware updating platform to enhance the process of updating firmware. A smart contract is used to ensure integrity and enforce the scanning of malicious code. With a peer-to-peer file sharing system, our platform enjoys high availability without the single failure point problem, mitigating the possibility of DDoS attacks. We use batch verification in case of multiple updating requests for better scalability.

However, there are still challenges to address, such as the massive amount of data generated in high speeds and the fast processing requirements and also challenges in the security domain, such as data integrity and ID authentication. Currently decentralized IoT/Fog network architectures would come in handy, in order to release data processing 'burden' from isolated Cloud servers. On the other hand, Blockchain has emerged as a key technology for handling manufacturing, raw or processed data, in safety and security environment, while distributing it to the physical world, consisting of heterogeneous entities, such as manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, logistics agents or simple clients, thus reinforcing the IT and automation potentials of product supply chain. In this paper we propose an abstraction layer architecture that solves all that issues. On the one hand, there is a decentralized IOT/Fog and cloud framework for real time machine condition monitoring (MCM) and fault prediction, where computational demanding tasks are distributed across fog nodes and decision fusion rules are set and controlled by the Cloud. On the other hand, a peer to peer Blockchain ledger is also proposed for integrating the IOT/Fog, MCM network architecture along with other entities of the physical world, making supply chain network more efficient and intelligent.

In this regard, various use cases and designs have been proposed that seek to leverage the desirable properties blockchain technologies seem to offer. While many of the principles behind blockchain have actually been studied under the veil of Byzantine fault tolerance for decades, some approaches, such as relying on game-theoretic incentives and proof-of-work (PoW), are not yet fully understood. This knowledge gap can leave both practitioners and researchers in a difficult position regarding a possible application of such technologies, as it is often unclear what guarantees and characteristics a particular blockchain design actually achieves.

One of the uses of IoT is as an environmental monitoring system. In its application, IoT-based environmental monitoring systems are composed of one or more sensors placed in various locations and connected to each other using certain protocols. The problem arises when thousands of IoT devices connected together in one network and using the server-client connection model which raises several works in the synchronization process and access control management. This kind of network depends on a server as the center of control management that work as storing and distributing data from the sensor so that any data comes from the server is considered correct. To overcome this problem, it is proposed an IoT system that uses Blockchain technology which is a distributed data structure that forms blocks that do not require central authority and verification from third parties. From the experiments conducted can be evaluated that blockchain communication is much slower compared to MQTT communication protocol in terms of speed. The data transmission between node is measured with an average delay of 200ms. This system also visualizes data in graph with a high mobility data collection using vehicle so that it can be used to be an alternative of public participatorial measurement. © 2019 IEEE.","Air Quality Measurements; Blockchain; Distributed Network; Internet of Things; Vehicle as a Mobile Sensor Network","Access control; Air quality; Blockchain; Data communication systems; Information management; Monitoring; Sensor networks; Vehicles; Access control managements; Air quality measurements; Distributed data structures; Distributed networks; Environmental monitoring system; Internet of thing (IOT); Mobile sensor networks; Sensor data communication; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075832712

The privacy, reliability, and integrity of communication must be ensured so that actions can be accurate and implemented promptly after receiving actionable information. Because vehicles are equipped with the ability to compute, communicate, and sense their environment, there is a concomitant critical need to create and maintain trust among network entities in the context of the network's dynamism, an issue that requires building and validating the trust between entities in a small amount of time before entities leave each other's range.

Mirai Botnet malware exploits vulnerabilities of IoT devices resulting in massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate Mirai botnet attacks, but most of them are centralized or just provide precautionary steps to secure the IoT devices. This paper addresses IoT security against Mirai Botnet attacks using a novel blockchain based architecture. In our proposed approach, the network is divided into different Autonomous Systems (AS), through which host connectivity is established. Blockchains are used to store and share a list of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of different hosts connected to an AS, indicating which of these have been identified as malicious. Every AS monitors the communication activity inside the network using the proposed approach and determines whether a host is infected with malware or not by comparing the total number of packets sent by the host with a specified threshold value. The proposed approach is simulated on a custom developed simulator which is used to determine a suitable value for the malicious threshold. The results indicate that the proposed solution works effectively in blocking malicious packets from the infected host so that they do not affect the response time of the victim. Furthermore, a scalability analysis is conducted and the block propagation delay is evaluated for different AS sizes and consensus algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Blockchain; Botnet; Denial-of-service attack; Internet of things; Malware; Network security; Communication activities; Consensus algorithms; Distributed denial of service attack; Exponential growth; Internet of Things (IOT); Internet protocol address; Scalability analysis; Security configurations; Internet protocols",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073800333

Recently, blockchain is gaining attention due to combining with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the industrial field. Moreover, many researchers have proposed the Industrial IoT (IIoT) architecture with blockchain for data integrity and efficient management. The IIoT network consists of many heterogeneous devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, and programmable logic controllers (PLC)) with resources-constrained, and the availability of the network must be preferentially considered. Therefore, applying the existed blockchain technology is still challenging. There are some results about the technique of constructing blockchain lightly to solve this challenge. However, in these results, the analysis in perspective of cryptographic performance (area, throughput, and power consumption) has not been considered sufficiently, or only focused on the architecture of the blockchain network. The blockchain technology is based on cryptographic techniques, and the main part is a cryptographic hash function. Therefore, if we construct the blockchain-based IIoT architecture, we have to consider the performance of the hash function. Many lightweight hash functions have been proposed recently for the resource-constrained environment, and it can also be used to the blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the considerations of lightweight blockchain for IIoT. Also, we conduct an analysis of lightweight hash for blockchain, and propose a new lightweight hash-based blockchain architecture that can change the hash algorithm used for mining adjust to network traffic. © 2019 by the authors.","Blockchain; Industrial IoT; Lightweight hash; Resource-constrained devices; Security",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072387027

Retrieving of medical images is of great importance to facilitate disease diagnosis and improve treatment efficiency. However, it may raise privacy concerns from individuals, since medical images contain patients' sensitive and private information. Existing studies on retrieval of medical data either fail to protect sensitive information of medical images or are limited to a single image data provider. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based system for medical image retrieval with privacy protection. We first describe the typical scenarios of medical image retrieval and summarize the corresponding requirements in system design. Using the emerging blockchain techniques, we present the layered architecture and threat model of the proposed system. In order to accommodate large-size images with storage-constrained blocks, we capture a carefully selected feature vector from each medical image and design a customized transaction structure, which protects the privacy of medical images and image features. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities of future research. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Blockchain; Content based retrieval; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Image enhancement; Internet of things; Medical imaging; Disease diagnosis; Layered architecture; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Private information; Sensitive informations; Transaction structure; Treatment efficiency; Search engines",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073332226

This creates a large amount of data with location references, having an influence on the employees privacy - especially if personal references to employees are possible. To investigate this topic, a use case was carried out in an industrial environment. Therefore, a self-developed asset tracking (AT) system was developed and compared with a Commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) AT-System with regard to functionality and employee privacy. One mayor finding was that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based legacy system has weaknesses with regard to privacy, e.g. the advertising-data of mobile devices of the employees were stored in the cloud application of the system provider. This data can be used to determine the position of employees. With the self-developed system these weaknesses were avoided by using a Privacy by Design (PbD) approach. Therefore, this paper focuses on employee privacy in industrial AT applications and provides a PbD concept for wireless sensor networks in industrial environments. © 2019 IEEE.","asset tracking; block-chain; data privacy; employee privacy; IIoT; information visualization; location privacy","Data visualization; Factory automation; Information systems; Internet of things; Legacy systems; Manufacture; Personnel; Wireless sensor networks; Asset tracking; Employee privacy; IIoT; Information visualization; Location privacy; Data privacy",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074212585

However, it is going to be hard enough convincing that the blockchain technology could completely replace the trust among trading partners in the sharing economy as sharing services always operate in a highly dynamic environment.With the rapid expanding of the rental market, the sharing economy faces more and more severe challenges in the form of regulatory uncertainty and concerns about abuses. This paper proposes an enhanced decentralized sharing economy service using the service level agreement (SLA), which documents the services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet.

RFID offers the ability to save organizations time and costs by enabling data of traceability, identification, communication, temperature and location in real time for both people and resources. However, the RFID systems challenges are financial, technical, organizational and above all privacy and security. For this reason, recent works focus on attribute-based access control (ABAC) schemes. Currently, ABAC are based on mostly centralized models, which in environments such as the supply chain can present problems of scalability, synchronization and trust between the parties. In this manuscript, we implement an ABAC model in RFID systems based on a decentralized model such as blockchain. Common criteria for the selection of the appropriate blockchain are detailed. Our access control policies are executed through the decentralized application (DApp), which interfaces with the blockchain through the smart contract. Smart contracts and blockchain technology, on the one hand, solve current centralized systems issues as well as being flexible infrastructures that represent the relationship of trust and support essential in the ABAC model in order to provide the security of RFID systems. Our system has been designed for a supply chain environment with an use case suitable for healthcare systems, so that assets such as surgical instruments containing an associated RFID tag can only access to specific areas. Our system is deployed in both a local and Testnet environment in order to stablish a deep comparison and determining the technical feasibility. © 2019 by the authors.

Driven by the progress in the field of deep learning, significant advances have been achieved in recent years. This causes even complex image manipulation and analysis tasks to be easily applicable by a wide audience. Combined with traditional attack methods, this results in new attack vectors. In this paper, we present HEHLKAPPE, an application to hide persons from real-time video streams while keeping other movement untouched. The application is fully automated and does not require any domain knowledge in deep learning, image manipulation or other related areas in order to use it. In addition, we present 2 attack vectors to access the video stream to enable the manipulation. Our evaluation shows that HEHLKAPPE works well with static camera positions, is able to adapt to background changes and therefore is suitable to deceive observers. The discussion of the results discovers potential for improvement by using even more sophisticated techniques. We are confident that these techniques will be applicable in real-time in the near future. Appropriate countermeasures to mitigate our attack include improving the state of IoT security and verifying the authenticity of each frame using a blockchain-linke structure. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Challenges; Cryptocurrency; Ethereum; Motivation; Survey","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Electronic money; Ethereum; Information dissemination; Internet of things; Motivation; Open source software; Open systems; Program debugging; Software reliability; Software testing; Supply chain management; Surveying; Surveys; Challenges; Domain specific design; Hostile environments; Internet of Things (IOT); Open source software projects; Security and reliabilities; Software development tools; Technological complexity; Software design",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064888239

Computing resource trading unavoidably happens in edge-assisted IoT. However, efficient computing resource trading cannot be achieved because of the 'cold start' and 'long return' problems. To address these challenges, we propose to use a credit-based payment for fast computing resource trading in edge-assisted blockchain-enabled IoT; therefore, the IoT nodes can finish fast payment and frequent trading by borrowing resource coins from other IoT nodes based on their credit values. In our resource-coin loan problem, we propose an iterative double-auction-based algorithm, where a broker is introduced to solve the loan allocation problem and to determine the size of the loan each lender would provide to each borrower. Furthermore, the broker enforces specific loan pricing rules to induce the borrowers and lenders to bid truthfully. Then, the hidden privacy information could be extracted to achieve the optimal resource-coin allocation and loan pricing. The proposed algorithm can maximize the economic benefits while protecting privacy. Simulations showed that the proposed algorithm can maximize social welfare. In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with the credit-bank-based method in terms of the satisfaction function and payments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was individually rational, truthful, and budget-balanced. © 2014 IEEE.","Computing resource trading; double auction; edge computing; Internet of Things (IoT); loan","Blockchain; Budget control; Commerce; Costs; Edge computing; Electronic trading; Fast response computer systems; Iterative methods; Allocation problems; Computational task; Computing resource; Double auction; Internet of Things (IOT); loan; Privacy information; Satisfaction functions; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066292107

The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the examples of smart contract implementations. © 2019 IEEE.","and services; architecture; Blockchain technology (BCT); consensus; cyber-physics system; distributed system; Internet of Things (IoT); smart contract","Architecture; Benchmarking; Blockchain; Embedded systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Information services; Interoperability; Network architecture; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Trusted computing; Web services; and services; consensus; cyber-physics system; Distributed systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069904891

However, most existing blockchain schemes were not dedicated to the IoT ecosystem and hence could not meet the specific requirements of IoT. This paper aims to fix the gap. Inspired by Chainspace, a blockchain platform which could be applicable in IoT, VChain is proposed, a novel blockchain scheme suitable for IoT which is more secure, concrete, and practical compared with Chainspace. Specifically, in VChain, a two-layer BFT-based consensus protocol with HoneyBadger BFT protocol is proposed and a collective signature scheme as building blocks. The designs above allow for supporting faulty-shards-tolerance and asynchronous network model, which could not be sustained in Chainspace, and keeping high efficiency as well. Moreover, the sharding strategy presented in VChain, different from that in RapidChain, which adopts the energy-consuming PoW mechanism for sharding, is environmentfriendly and thus makes VChain fit for IoT well. Last but not least, VChain also inherits the merits of Chainspace to separate the execution and verification of smart contracts for privacy. © 2019 IEEE.","BIoT; Blockchain; Sharding; Two-Layer-BFT","Big data; Blockchain; Data privacy; Asynchronous networks; BIoT; Consensus protocols; Environment friendly; Internet of thing (IOT); Sharding; Tamper resistance; Two-layer; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075167235

Unfortunately, because of the unique characteristics of resource constraints, short-range communication, and self-organization in IoT, it always resorts to the cloud or fog nodes for outsourced computation and storage, which has brought about a series of novel challenging security and privacy threats. For this reason, one of the critical challenges of having numerous IoT devices is the capacity to manage them and their data. A specific concern is from which devices or Edge clouds to accept join requests or interaction requests. This paper discusses a design concept for developing the IoT data management platform, along with a data management and lineage traceability implementation of the platform based on blockchain and smart contracts, which approaches the two major challenges: how to implement effective data management and enrich rational interoperability for trusted groups of linked Things; And how to settle conflicts between untrusted IoT devices and its requests taking into account security and privacy preserving. Experimental results show that the system scales well with the loss of computing and communication performance maintaining within the acceptable range, works well to effectively defend against unauthorized access and empower data provenance and transparency, which verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the design concept to provide privacy, fine-grained, and integrity data management over the IoT devices by introducing the blockchain-based data management platform. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Data Management; Internet of Things (IoT); Privacy","Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Information management; Communication performance; Critical challenges; Internet of Things (IOT); Management platforms; Resource Constraint; Security and privacy; Short-range communication; Unauthorized access; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073594592

Considerable amounts of data accordingly need to be download and stored at decentralized nodes to carry out meaningful validations. For the Bitcoin blockchain, approximately 197 GB must currently be downloaded and processed by any node aiming to fully verify the correctness of stored transactions. This represents an emerging problem with respect to resource-constrained thin clients that lack the required download or storage capacities, but with which meaningful validations still need to be carried out. This problem will gain even more relevance in the future, as blockchain technology is applied to new domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) that necessitate the use of thin clients. We address this emerging problem by proposing a novel compressible blockchain architecture. In our proposal, we use a snapshot-based approach, to create snapshots of the blockchain at regular intervals and store them in blocks. These blocks are chained, forming a second blockchain that is linked to the primary chain. In this way, the amount of data that needs to be downloaded and stored by decentralized nodes is reduced considerably, while the full validation of the entire blockchain still remains feasible. In this paper, we describe the proposed compressible blockchain architecture in detail. We conducted evaluations that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution and show its advantages over related approaches introduced in the literature. Overall, our design can be used to reduce the size of the blockchain by up to 93%, facilitating secure blockchain-based applications even on resource-constrained thin clients such as IoT devices. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain size; Compressible blockchain; Resource constrained devices; Snapshot; Thin client; UTXO","Big data; Bitcoin; Data privacy; Digital storage; Internet of things; Internet of thing (IOT); Resourceconstrained devices; Snapshot; Storage capacity; Thin clients; UTXO; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075130294

Like many other sectors, transportation has entered a period of rapid change. Intelligent Traffic System is one of the fastest-growing fields within the smart systems, which is expected to increase road safety, mitigate traffic congestion, and enable fuel efficiency. The main functionalities of Intelligent Traffic System are as follows: (1) monitoring real-time traffic conditions in specific areas, (2) locating traffic emergencies (i.e. traffic accidents) in specific areas, and (3) dynamic monitoring and managing the continuous use in public transit services (i.e. change in car lanes) that may lead to changes in macro traffic conditions. This article will use the above-mentioned functionalities of the Intelligent Traffic System as underlying simulative scenarios, to design and to implement a smart transportation system based on Internet of things and blockchain—both share inherent distributed technology characteristics—combining both Internet of things sensor nodes and distributed ledger technology, to (1) record the changes in intelligent transportation systems and (2) set up a credit-token mechanism for paying the use and misuses in public transit services accordingly. The Intelligent Traffic System described in this article is intended to be used as experimental project only, given the terms and conditions as depicted in the simulated scenario. In real-life traffic scenarios, it may generate more complex system and data security issues, which will be elaborated and analyzed at the end of this article. Intelligent Traffic System is a comprehensive smart system; it can significantly change and reinvent the wheel for traffic conditions. Based on the system development as discussed in this article, there are still a lot of demands and challenges that need to be addressed in the future. Such topic scope will be explored in depth in our subsequent research. © The Author(s) 2019.","blockchain; credit strategy algorithm; decentralized system; Intelligent traffic system; Internet of things; smart contract; wireless data transmission","Accidents; Advanced public transportation systems; Blockchain; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Motor transportation; Sensor nodes; Urban transportation; Continuous development; Decentralized system; Distributed technologies; Experimental projects; Intelligent traffic systems; Intelligent transportation systems; Real-time traffic conditions; Wireless data transmission; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071716319

The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem)in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground)vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs)is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs’ requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network's backbone to transfer EVs’ requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the potential deployment of BEST in energy trading. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","5G; Blockchain; Energy trading; Intelligent transportation system; Smart city; Smart nation; Software-defined networking; Tactile Internet","Antennas; Blockchain; Commerce; Ecosystems; Electric power transmission networks; Information services; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet of things; Network security; Power markets; Smart city; Software defined networking; Unmanned vehicles; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy trading; Intelligent transportation; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Realtime processing; Smart nation; Technological trends; Smart power grids",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066274740

However, its utilization in resource-constrained mobile devices is limited due to high demands of resources and poor scalability with frequent-intensive transactions. Edge computing can be integrated to facilitate mobile devices in offloading their mining tasks to cloud resources. This integration ensures reliable access, distributed computation and untampered storage for scalable and secure transactions. It is imperative therefore that crucial issues of security, scalability and resources management be addressed to achieve successful integration. Studies have been conducted to explore suitable architectural requirements, and some researchers have applied the integration to deploy some specific applications. Despite these efforts, however, issues of anonymity, adaptability and integrity still need to be investigated further to attain a practical, secure decentralized data storage. We based our study on peer-to-peer and blockchain to achieve an Internet of Things (IoT) design supported by edge computing to acquire security and scalability levels needed for the integration. We investigated existing blockchain and associated technologies to discover solutions that address anonymity, integrity and adaptability issues for successful integration of blockchain in IoT systems.

There is esteem; by 2020 there will be 26 times more connected things than people. Hence, the concern of security rises along with the high installments. The BlockChain Technology takes place of all central entities, which is peer to peer communication with the distributed network. In this paper, two Arduino boards as nodes and a Raspberry Pi as server are to be configured to connect to the Wi-Fi using ESP8266(node mc). To make data transmission from the two nodes to server, integration of temperature and humidity sensor in one node and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) reader in other node is to be done. Data should be in the form of blocks and integration of data is in the form of a chain, forming it a Blockchain. All the blocks are linked in the chain manner of which the current hash of the previous block must match with the previous hash of the next block. Then only the blocks of data are secured. While receiving data every time from nodes to server, the previous hash is to be checked such that the arrival of the information is being verified to know if it’s really genuine. If the cryptographic hash does not match then data manipulation is happened.

We use a decentralized storage network for reducing the load on the vendor when distributing patches toward IoT devices, and eliminating central points of failure. Unlike existing peer-to-peer file sharing networks which have a fundamental availability problem for unpopular files, our protocol utilizes blockchain-based smart contracts to incentivize independent peers, termed distributors, by means of cryptocurrency payments. A vendor of IoT devices deploys a smart contract with a deposit, which acts as a publicly verifiable binding bid for delivery of patches to a specific set of IoT endpoints. Distributors will compete for delivering the updates to the desired IoT devices and present proofs-of-distribution in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. We address the fair exchange problem between distributors and the consuming IoT devices by utilizing a variation of the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) protocol, ensuring that the process is trustless. This can encourage the participation of a large number of distributors, and thus facilitate a rapid scale-out of the system. Finally, we present and evaluate a prototype implementation combining the BitTorrent network with the cryptocurrency Ethereum. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Distributed computer systems; Electronic money; Knowledge management; Peer to peer networks; Contingent payments; Fair exchange problems; Peer-to-peer file sharing networks; Prototype implementations; Publicly verifiable; Software updates; Storage networks; Zero knowledge; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066926531

Our second contribution relates to the fairness of the Tendermint algorithm. We have considered the block sensitivity and node's trustworthiness for determining the size of voter's (validator's) subset and employed the random walk algorithm for the fair selection of sub set of the voter nodes.

This paper proposes a mechanism based on a combinatorial double auction to offload the mining process of miners to the edge servers. The mechanism is formulated as a resource allocation problem. The corresponding allocation algorithms and payment scheme are proposed to allocate resources and calculate trade prices, respectively. Moreover, this paper proves that the proposed mechanism is efficient in terms of computation, and it satisfies three properties of economic auction which are budget balance, individual rationality and truthfulness. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is able to yield higher total utility, together with good scalability. For the case of 900 miners in the auction, the total utility of the proposed mechanism is higher than two existing works by 39.2% and 569.9% on average, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","auction; blockchain; group buying; mobile edge computing; vm allocation","Budget control; Data communication systems; Data mining; Edge computing; Miners; Resource allocation; Smart city; Allocation algorithm; auction; Combinatorial double auctions; Group buying; Individual rationality; Mobile applications; Resource allocation problem; vm allocation; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073533074

In blockchain operation process, mining tasks play a key role and pose intensive computation demands on resource constrained mobile devices. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution to alleviate the heavy burden on the devices through task offloading. Since only the miner device that first obtains a block can get rewards, there are risks of the devices for consuming edge computing resources without any profit. However, traditional task offloading schemes that purely rely on expected utilities of the devices always ignore the difference of various devices in balancing risks and rewards, thus make the offloading inefficient. To address this problem, we adopt a prospect theoretic approach to design an optimal offloading scheme for MEC-empowered blockchain, where diverse preferences of devices for profits and risks are explicitly taken into account. Specifically, we formulate the offloading process as a Stackelberg game that incorporates notions from prospect theory. We design an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal offloading strategies, which maximize the utilities of both the miner devices and the MEC service providers. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed offloading schemes. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; MEC","Computation theory; Edge computing; Internet of things; Miners; Profitability; Computing resource; Economic transactions; Expected utility; Mobile applications; Numerical results; Operation process; Service provider; Stackelberg Games; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075633597

IoT provides a medium for software part to interact with the physical part which is energy and transmission grid. IoT connects the physical battery containing the energy to the cloud database which is then used to interact with the software. IoT also enables the transfer of energy through the physical medium on the command given by the user through the user application. To make the system decentralized, blockchain is used, which helps to connect all the users in the network where they can transact without the need of knowing each other or having the obligation of any intermediary. Decentralisation helps in achieving a system which doesn't require any middleman and works on the cumulative trust of the nodes - often referred to as the Consensus-Based Algorithm. There are a number of such algorithms but Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are widely used for blockchains. We suggest using the PoW algorithm. We need to take care if the certain conditions meet before enabling any user to transact. For such condition, we used the application logic on the server side to enable a valid transaction (similar to smart contracts on Ethereum). Blockchain also offers security, transparency, immutability and customer centricity to develop the most advanced and automated platform. In brief, the working of the system can be explained as - Sunlight makes the Solar panels charge the physical battery which is connected to the microcontroller. The microcontroller continuously updates the data to the cloud database which is accessed by the application. The application logic checks for the required conditions and if the required conditions are met, the transaction takes place and the blockchain is updated (a block is created and added to the blockchain enabling the transaction). On the physical side, the IoT devices receive a command to allow the transfer of energy to the particular node. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Blockchain, Integrity; Consensus; Cryptocurrency; Decentralisation; Flask using python; Internet of things (IoT)","Blockchain; Computer circuits; Electric batteries; Electronic money; Energy transfer; Microcontrollers; Solar energy; Application logic; Consensus; Decentralisation; Energy distributions; Flask using python; Internet of Things (IOT); Physical medium; Transmission grids; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072017193

Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Hierarchical Storage; Industrial IoT","Digital storage; Internet of things; Large scale systems; Network architecture; Overlay networks; Centralized architecture; Cloud infrastructures; Heterogeneous devices; Hierarchical storage; Industrial IoT; Iot architectures; Proposed architectures; Storage structures; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074801146

Data de-centralization and mature encryption technology based on blockchain technology provide a proper security guarantee for HIoT. However, common blockchain technology consensus algorithm consumes a lot of computing resources of devices, and it is easy to cause network congestion in LAN due to the size of each transaction and transactions' frequently spread. Just Blockchain Storage Model (JBSM) means every blockchain node in the network stores all of the transaction data that launched in the whole blockchain network, there is no doubt that JBSM consumes a lot of storage resources.

However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which may not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present B-IoT, a blockchain based IoT system with credit-based consensus mechanism.

In order to protect the confidentiality of sensitive IoT data, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured blockchain, which is more efficient than the satoshi-style blockchain. We implement a prototype of B-IoT on Raspberry Pi, and conduct case studies of a smart factory. Extensive evaluation and analysis results demonstrate that the proposed credit-based PoW mechanism and data access control are practical for IoT. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Credit based; Directed acyclic graph; Internet of Things; Proof of work; Security","Access control; Blockchain; Directed graphs; Distributed computer systems; Network security; Credit based; Data access control; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Evaluation and analysis; Internet of Things (IOT); Management method; Proof of work; Security; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074825944

The mobile IoT systems generate an enormous volume of a variety of dynamic context data and typically count on centralized architectures to process them. However, their inability to ensure security and decline in communication efficiency and response time with the increase in the size of IoT network are some of the many concerning weaknesses that are holding back the fast-paced growth of IoT. Realizing the limitations of centralized systems, recently blockchain-based decentralized architecture is being considered as the key to redesigning the IoT systems in a way that is designed to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient. However, before realizing the new promise of blockchain for IoT, there are significant challenges to address. One fundamental challenge is the scale issue around data collection, storage, and analytic as IoT sensor devices possess limited computational power and storage capabilities. In particular, since the chain is always growing, IoT devices require more and more resources. Thus, an oversized chain poses storage and scalability problems.

It has been applied to stock trading, supply chain auditing, crowd-funding, energy trading, and Internet-of-Things. Specifically, in Internet-of-Things applications, how the data is transmitted before reaching a blockchain platform reliably is a challenging issue. In this paper, we focus on an energy trading scenario with Internet-of-Things blockchain applications for energy trading. In this scenario, energy generated from renewable sources can be traded in a peer-To-peer manner among micro-grids. This requires a high level of data communication reliability. Blockchain is adopted as an effective decentralized transaction management solution. In particular, we propose a proof-of-concept for reliable data transmission from smart meters to the blockchain based on Sigfox technology and the Ethereum. To enhance reliability, we configure the base station antenna as a block-based mode and propose a physical data layer for wireless communication.

Meanwhile, inherent vulnerabilities of IoT systems (including firmware and software) have been continually uncovered and thus the systems are always exposed to various attacks. The root cause of the issue is that IoT systems always have design flaws and implementation bugs. In particular, the released systems (e.g., by third-party marketplaces and IoT vendors) may be maliciously repackaged with malware. Unfortunately, IoT consumers are not able to effectively capture such vulnerabilities because of the limited detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose SmartCrowd, a blockchain-based platform that aims to outsource security detection of IoT systems to distributed detectors with strong detection incentives. SmartCrowd enables built-in accountability for IoT providers and authoritative references of detection results for IoT consumers. By building smart contracts, we can incentivize the efficient and high-coverage security detection of IoT systems, while providing decentralized and automated incentives for both IoT providers releasing secure IoT systems and detectors uncovering vulnerabilities. We present the security and theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security of SmartCrowd and the incentives for participators. We prototype SmartCrowd by using Ethereum and the experimental results show that SmartCrowd has both technical feasibility and financial benefits, which can be applied to build a secure IoT ecosystem. © 2019 IEEE.","Automation; Blockchain; Decentralization; Incentives; IoT System Detection","Automation; Blockchain; Distributed computer systems; Firmware; Malware; Program debugging; Decentralization; Detection capability; Financial benefits; Incentives; Internet of Things (IOT); Outsource security; Security detection; Various attacks; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074859786

Prior to transmitting to MEC, HD experience encryption in order to provide protection against cyber threats. Moreover, after arriving at MEC, HD are diagnosed and if any abnormalities are found in the user's health, MEC server notifies the user and the nearest hospitals.

The privacy, reliability, and integrity of communications must be ensured so that actions can be appropriate, safe, accurate, and implemented promptly after receiving actionable information. In this work, we present a multi-Tier methodology consisting of an authentication and trust-building/distribution framework designed to ensure the safety and validity of the information exchanged in the system. Blockchain protocols and Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attributes (RF-DNA) combine to provide a hardware-software codesigned system for enhanced device identity and overall system trustworthiness. Our threat model accounts for counterfeiting, breakout fraud, and bad mouthing of one entity by others. Entity trust (e.g., IoT devices) depends on quality and level of participation, quality of messages, lifetime of a given entity in the system, and the number of known 'bad' (non-consensus) messages sent by that entity. Based on this approach to trust, we are able to adjust trust upward and downward as a function of real-Time and past behavior, providing other participants with a trust value upon which to judge information from and interactions with the given entity. This approach thereby reduces the potential for manipulation of an IoT system by a bad or byzantine actor. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; IoT; RF-DNA Fingerprinting; Trust management","Blockchain; Computer software; Gene encoding; Green computing; Hardware-software codesign; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Communication technologies; DNA fingerprinting; Hardware software co-designed; Internet of thing (IOT); Operational efficiencies; Potential benefits; Radio frequencies; Trust management; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074841556

Studies on overcoming the limitations of scalability and stability in a centralized IoT operating environment by employing distributed blockchain technology have been actively conducted. However, the nature of IoT that ensures connectivity with multiple objects at any time and any place increases security threats. Further, it extends the influence of the cyber world into the physical domain, resulting in serious damage to human life and property. Therefore, we aim to study a method to increase the security of IoT devices and effectively extend them simultaneously. To this end, we analyze the authentication methods and limitations of traditional IoT devices and examine cases for improving IoT environments by using blockchain technology. Accordingly, we propose a framework that allows IoT devices to be securely connected and extended to other devices by automatically evaluating security using blockchain technology and the whitelist. The method proposed in this paper restricts the extension of devices vulnerable to security risks by imposing penalties and allows only devices with high security to be securely and quickly authenticated and extended without user intervention. In this study, we applied the proposed method to IoT network simulation environments and observed that the number of devices vulnerable to security was reduced by 48.5% compared with traditional IoT environments. © 2019 by the authors.","Authentication; Blockchain; IoT; Scalability; Secure; Whitelist",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069906596

Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth.

In this mechanism, the process of generating a new block in the blockchain is referred to as mining. Such process is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and time consuming so that the rate of block generation remains steady. A single participant, called a miner usually has limited computation power to produce PoWs. This leads miners to form a mining pool, where miners aggregate their computing power and share the rewards. However, a phenomenon raises in such a mining pool activity, where miners attack each other. Consequently, this results in a decrease in total rewards received from the mining pool. To address the abovementioned problem, we build a multi-miner model for forming a mining pool. We further propose a method to improve the cooperation-probability of miners in the pool by introducing a Zero-Determinant strategy and a Temporal Difference learning method (TD(λ)). Experimental simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively promote the cooperation among miners, therefore, increase the rewards received from the formed mining pool. © 2019 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Block withholding Attack; Blockchain; Temporal Difference Learning Method; Zero-Determinant Strategy","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Green computing; Internet of things; Lakes; Miners; Block withholding Attack; Computation power; Cooperation probability; Cooperative evolution; Experimental simulations; Temporal difference learning; Temporal differences; Zero-Determinant Strategy; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074861549

The first part discusses the relationship between the Bregman divergence and the probabilistic alpha-divergence. There, a new alpha-divergence is derived from the Bregman divergence by skewing the probability space. In the second part, both the alpha-EM algorithm and the traditional log-EM algorithm are derived simultaneously from this single divergence. The third part is on the applications to the blockchain. The EM families are effective in statistical machine learning that can be incorporated in miners of blockchains for evaluating the data sent from clients. Any miner appreciates the speed in order to contest with other miners. The alpha-EM matches this purpose because of its faster speed than the log-EM.

In such systems it is very hard to keep track of user data, enforce complex privacy policies, ensure safe data storage and sharing, as well as employ an efficient mechanism for process and resource management. Blockchain is a technology that emerged in 2008 with Bitcoin, and has proven to be effective in solving these problems. IoT applications are distributed by nature. Hence, distributed ledger technology (DLT) such as blockchain has the potential to play a significant role in how devices communicate in IoT.

In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of blockchain-based Secure IoT as a Service (SIoTaaS), where an IoT device can be rented from a service provider, securely and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our framework allows the simultaneous operations of distinct providers of IoT-based sharing economy services at a large scale. Multiple parties can securely share text and multimedia in the context of location and point-of-interest sharing, perform financial transactions by hiding true identity of parties involved in various online transactions, perform user and IoT registration, transfer value transactions via Ethereum tokens between providers and consumers, as well as raw IoT data payload. This can turn smart room IoT devices, such as smart locks, light bulbs, air conditioning and fans into rentable business entities within a secure sharing economy platform.

Considering the integration of the blockchain technique and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain may act as a distributed ledger for beneficially establishing a decentralized autonomous trading platform for industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. However, the power and computation constraints prevent IoT devices from directly participating in this proof-of-work process. As a remedy, in this treatise, the cloud computing service is introduced into the blockchain platform for the sake of assisting to offload computational task from the IIoT network itself. In addition, we study the resource management and pricing problem between the cloud provider and miners. More explicitly, we model the interaction between the cloud provider and miners as a Stackelberg game, where the leader, i.e., cloud provider, makes the price first, and then miners act as the followers. Moreover, in order to find the Nash equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg game, a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm is conceived for searching the near-optimal policy. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to some state-of-the-art schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; cloud mining; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); multiagent reinforcement learning; Stackelberg game","Blockchain; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Electronic trading; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Miners; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Cloud computing services; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm; Near-optimal policies; Stackelberg Games; State-of-the-art scheme; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067355735

To meet the high throughput requirement, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IIoT systems, the goals of which are threefold: 1) providing a methodology for evaluating the system from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency, and security; 2) improving the scalability of the underlying blockchain without affecting the system's decentralization, latency, and security; and 3) designing a modulable blockchain for IIoT systems, where the block producers, consensus algorithm, block size, and block interval can be selected/adjusted using the DRL technique.

On one hand, due to the introductions of mathematical concepts, including Public Key Infrastructure, Merkle Hash Tree, and Proof of Work (PoW), deploying blockchain demands huge computing power. On the other hand, full nodes should synchronize massive block data and deal with numerous transactions in peer-to-peer network, whose occupation of storage capacity and bandwidth makes IIoT devices difficult to afford. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain system called LightChain, which is resource-efficient and suitable for power-constrained IIoT scenarios. Specifically, we present a green consensus mechanism named Synergistic Multiple Proof for stimulating the cooperation of IIoT devices, and a lightweight data structure called LightBlock to streamline broadcast content. Furthermore, we design a novel Unrelated Block Offloading Filter to avoid the unlimited growth of ledger without affecting blockchain's traceability. The extensive experiments demonstrate that LightChain can reduce the individual computational cost to 39.32% and speed up the block generation by up to 74.06%.

To establish a secure private market, some meaningful works propose the concept of the energy chain, where one block is added in a linear and chronological order once the trading pair of nodes (buyer and seller) has a valid transaction verified by data audit (e.g., a hash value). Since the buyer applies virtual coins from the credit bank to buy others' surplus energy, a considerable credit utility is obtained if all nodes are encouraged to meet local power loads out of self-interest. However, such frequent transactions have huge operational overhead, including a long chain maintaining many blocks and an expensive energy transportation cost between trading pairs. To solve these challenging issues, our method enables nodes to satisfy their power loads through local stored energy (self-sufficiency), before participating as sellers if they still have considerable surplus electricity. Without transactions made by some self-sufficient nodes, the operational overhead can be mitigated in a more secure environment. Taking the classic Internet of energy as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions, and it can achieve a good tradeoff between credit utility and operational overhead. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; energy trading; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); local electricity storage","Blockchain; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Internet of things; Chronological order; Electricity storages; Energy trading; Energy transportation; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Meaningful works; Operational Overheads; Surplus energy; Power markets",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067363111

However, two key challenges still remain. One is how to achieve high-quality data collection with limited MT energy resource and sensing range. Another is how to ensure security when sharing and exchanging data among MTs, to prevent possible device failure, network communication failure, malicious users or attackers, etc. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled efficient data collection and secure sharing scheme combining Ethereum blockchain and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a reliable and safe environment.

However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51% attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Chameleon hash (CH); chameleon signature (CS); consortium blockchain; industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT); sanitization","Authentication; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Hash functions; Internet of things; Network security; Chameleon hash (CH); Chameleon signatures; Decentralized design; Following problem; industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT); Public-key signatures; Sanitization; Security analysis; Blockchain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067348110

In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer-retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum.

Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; Cournot model; Industrial internet of thing (iot); smart contract; Stochastic geometry","Authentication; Blockchain; Digital storage; Heterogeneous networks; Quality of service; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Authentication and authorization; Cournot model; Cryptographic algorithms; Decentralized networks; Equilibrium distributions; Internet of thing (IoTs); Internet of Things (IOT); Stochastic geometry; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067046765

However, as the number of nodes and network size become larger, the traditional IIoT architecture can no longer provide effective support for such enormous system. Therefore, we introduce the Blockchain architecture, which is an emerging scheme for constructing the distributed networks, to reshape the traditional IIoT architecture. First, the major problems of the traditional IIoT architecture are analyzed, and the existing improvements are summarized. Second, we introduce a security and privacy model to help design the Blockchain-based architecture. On this basis, we decompose and reorganize the original IIoT architecture to form a new multicenter partially decentralized architecture. Then, we introduce some relative security technologies to improve and optimize the new architecture. After that we design the data interaction process and the algorithms of the architecture. Finally, we use an automatic production platform to discuss the specific implementation. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture provides better security and privacy protection than the traditional architecture. Thus, the proposed architecture represents a significant improvement of the original architecture, which provides a new direction for the IIoT development. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); security and privacy; smart factory","Blockchain; Internet of things; Automatic production; Decentralized architecture; Distributed networks; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Proposed architectures; Security and privacy; Security and privacy protection; Traditional architecture; Network architecture",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067335894

However, existing IIoT systems are vulnerable to single point of failure and malicious attacks, which cannot provide stable services. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) gains considerable interest. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present a blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism for IIoT. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which can guarantee system security and transaction efficiency simultaneously. In order to protect sensitive data confidentiality, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on directed acyclic graph -structured blockchains, which is more efficient than the Satoshi-style blockchain in performance. We implement the system on Raspberry Pi, and conduct a case study for the smart factory.

The blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) solution which has enormous potential as can be seen in the numerous avenues it has been deployed. Simplistically, it is a decentralized database which can revolutionize the current centralized world we live. IoT is the interconnection of devices with mostly bounded resources. IoT applications are also distributed in nature thereby making it inevitable that the paths of the blockchain and IoT will cross in the future. Blockchain's DLT will eventually play a crucial role in how IoT devices will communicate. The Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism was the original consensus technique introduced in the first blockchain based application (Bitcoin). PoW guaranteed consensus in the network by verifying transactions. However, the PoW had deficiencies. The solving of the PoW puzzle is computationally expensive which has become an impediment in the potential marriage of IoT and blockchain. This predicament arises as IoT devices are plagued with limited resources. In this work, we address this issue by presenting an approach where IoT devices can combine their resources to solve PoW puzzles that they might not have been able to solve on their own. This would ensure a successful merger between the blockchain and the IoT. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain for IoT; Blockchain for the Internet of Things; LightChain; Lightweight Blockchain","Blockchain; Decentralized database; Internet of thing (IOT); IOT applications; LightChain; Proof of work; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070897132

However, localization algorithms can be easily compromised by injecting false locations. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based secure localization algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT). The algorithm uses a public ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their neighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device is localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the Blockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT devices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious node sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are verified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between nodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity. The integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process permits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The simulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves the localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of malicious nodes. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Blockchain; Electronic data interchange; Mobile computing; Network security; Internet of thing (IOT); IOT applications; Localization accuracy; Localization algorithm; Localization errors; Malicious nodes; Secure localization; Security mechanism; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073891467

To address those issues, this paper introduces a Lightweight Blockchain based Cybersecurity (LBC) for IoT environments. Unlike the Proof of Work (PoS) and Proof of Stake (PoS) in Bitcoins, we aim to mitigate the heavy computational cost that required in a consensus algorithm to meet the IoT requirements. To provide scalability feature to the proposed scheme, Edge Block Manager (EBM) and Aggregation Block Managers (ABM) have been introduced; where EBM aims to overcome the limited capabilities of local IoT resources and manages local BC in centralized manner. While ABM constitute of numerous of EBM to manages the public BC in a distributed manner. Our novel proposed scheme can preserve high throughput and low latency. Obviously, waiting period, verification, and block appending period have been mitigated. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is resisted against typical attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; consensus-algorithm; cybersecurity; IoT; lightweight","Blockchain; Edge computing; Managers; Bandwidth consumption; Computational costs; Computational requirements; Consensus algorithms; Cyber security; Internet of Things (IOT); lightweight; Security and privacy; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074147891

Auction is a classical algorithm which guarantees that the computing resources are allocated to the buyers of the computing resource. However, the traditional auction algorithm only guarantees the revenue gains for the sellers of the computing resource. How to guarantee the seller and the buyer of the computing resource when both are willing to trade and moreover, bid truthfully, is still an open problem in computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted IoT. In this paper, we introduce a broker with sparse information to manage and adjust the trading market. We then propose an iterative double-sided auction scheme for computing resource trading, where the broker solves an allocation problem to determine how much computing resource is traded and designs a specific price rule to induce the buyers and sellers of the computing resource to submit bids in a truthful way. Thus, hidden information can be extracted gradually to obtain optimal computing resource allocation and trading prices. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve the maximum social welfare meanwhile protecting the privacies of the buyers and the sellers. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, i.e., it achieves the maximum social welfare. In addition, the proposed algorithm can provide effective trading strategies for the buyers and sellers of the computing resource, leading to the proposed algorithm satisfying incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Computing resource trading; double auction; edge-cloud computing; Internet of things (IoT)","Budget control; Combinatorial optimization; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Iterative methods; Resource allocation; Sales; Analysis and simulation; Computing resource; Double auction; Double sided auctions; Edge clouds; Incentive compatibility; Individual rationality; Internet of Things (IOT); Electronic trading",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066326523

However, many companies, especially small and medium enterprises, do not have sufficient data and experience due to their limited scale and resources. They need to rely on third parties, and this reliance results in the lack of development of core customer service competency. In order to overcome these challenges, an open and automated customer service platform based on Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and automated machine learning (AutoML) is proposed. The data are gathered with the use of IoT devices during the customer service. An open but secured environment to achieve data trading is ensured by using blockchain.

A crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakeholders, namely the platform, workers (e.g., individuals, sensors, or processors), and task publisher. The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion. First, we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders. Then the predefined rules are implemented using blockchain smart contract on many edge servers (ES) of the mobile edge computing network, which together function as a trustless hybrid human-machine crowd-intelligence platform. As ES are near to workers and publisher, network congestion can be effectively improved. Further, we proved the existence of the only one strong Nash equilibrium, which can maximize the interests of involved ES and make the ecosystem bigger. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the proposed method, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain smart contract; crowd-intelligence ecosystem; hybrid human-machine; mobile edge computing; reward and penalty; strong Nash equilibrium; trustless","Computation theory; Ecosystems; Edge computing; Game theory; Human-machine; Mutual trust; Nash equilibria; Network congestions; Penalty models; Reward and penalty; trustless; Video clips; Blockchain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067361311

Under this ecosystem, the IoT data marketplace (IDM) provides an online platform for IoT data trading. Most current IDM solutions are centralized, serving as an intermediary between the data provider and consumer. They support selling and buying data collections (e.g. pre-collected data sets and data streams). However, as these data collections are historically collected without having any priory requirements and preferences given by the data consumer, it is very likely that most of these data collections cannot fulfill data consumer requirements. Redundancy, poor data quality, inaccuracy and limited financial incentives are common problems for existing IDMs, thereby making them financially ineffective. Due to the temporal nature of IoT data, the issue of pre-collection becomes even more critical as it is not trivial to re-collect data from the past.This paper presents a novel framework with a new on-demand market model, namely Decentralized IoT Collectability Data Marketplace (DCDM) model. Difference from the conventional IDM models where merely data collections are considered as a commodity, our model also involves operational factors such as data provider availability, operationality, contextual and geographical location etc. This empowers our framework to trade not only the dataset but rather an ability of the data provider to fulfill the collection task. Our game-changing approach is realized using a combination of Blockchain and Crowdsensing techniques. We first explore the concept of 'Data Collectability' for IDM, then build a model to deploy our approach on IoT context. Furthermore, we identify potential applications and open research challenges. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Crowdsensing; Data Marketplace; Decentralized System; Internet of Things; IoT; Smart Contracts","Blockchain; Commerce; Data acquisition; Crowdsensing; Data marketplaces; Decentralized system; Financial incentives; Geographical locations; Internet of thing (IOT); Operational factors; Research challenges; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073891917

In this context, European laws imposes very strict requirements in the food industry, in order to ensure that food provenance is always guaranteed. Such fine-grained traceability can be only achieved by applying state-of-the-art technologies.

Future grids will be smarter and with a higher level of autonomy. In addition, the penetration of demand-side small-scale distributed generation is mounting. The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) conveys a promising and brilliant future for this technology, particularly for vehicles with V2G capability, that will result in a boom in the pervasiveness of EVs in the next decades. Digitalization and modernization of power systems, as well as ever-growing technological advances in information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet of things (IoT), will procure a smart platform that facilitates peer-to-peer (P2P) communication of power systems' elements. Thus, future power systems will be immensely complicated and interconnected in terms of data transfer and data processing. Hence, in addition to the employment of big data techniques, some structural changes are required to deal with such a massive body of data. Therefore, the security of data must be ensured specifically for financial transactions. Furthermore, in the future grids, millions of microsources will sell their generating power to the local loads in demand-side, and a load may be served by several microsources. Furthermore, flexible loads can use this platform to trade interchangeably with inelastic loads or the main grid. In this respect, myriad transactions must be recorded, which cannot be handled with the current banking system. This matter necessitates the deployment of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies for handling these microtransactions without needing to supervisory and authority. Hence, a proper platform is indispensable to connect the vendors and purchasers easily and executes the transaction after authentication, validation, and verification of both sides. This study delves into the necessity of employment of blockchain in power systems. Besides, the conceptual background of blockchain and cryptocurrency are explained. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Financial cybersecurity; Microtransaction; Restructured power systems","Blockchain; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Electronic money; Finance; Internet of things; Modernization; Peer to peer networks; Security of data; Smart power grids; Cyber security; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Financial transactions; Information and communications technology; Internet of thing (IOT); Microtransaction; Peer-to-peer communications; Restructured power systems; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076279685

These sensor data are instrumental in making smart decisions. In order to send data to end users, these sensors are connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Usually, the intra-domain data transmission is secure, indeed sensors and consumers of data can belong to the same Virtual Private Network (VPN). Security problems can be raised in the inter-domain data transmission because the transmitting channel is not ciphered nor is the identity of devices certain. Therefore, in case of attack, for consumers of data is not possible to recognize real data gathered from devices from fake data sent by attackers. In order to address this challenge, in this paper we present a novel method to secure data acquired from sensors connected to IoT devices. In particular, utilizing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the ESP32 microcontroller, we can send data privately to each recipient. In order to validate the system, we performed specific analysis considering different levels of security (512, 1024, 2048 bits key length) and increasing number of connected sensors (0, 1, 5, 10, 20). In particular, we considered the time to set up the IoT device and to cipher packets. Experiments have shown that the time required for the setup increases with the increase of the key length. Considering the 512 and 1024 bits keys, the time required to cipher data coming from sensors increase with the increasing of sensors. Instead, for the 2048 bits key length the ciphering time is almost constant, this because packet size and key length are comparable. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Cloud Computing; Edge Computing; Fog Computing; IoT; RSA","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Data transfer; Edge computing; Fog computing; Powertrains; Public key cryptography; Virtual private networks; Inter-domain; Interdomain communication; Internet of thing (IOT); Intra-domain; Public-key infrastructure; Security problems; Sensor data; Virtual private networks (VPN); Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071498498

Importantly, most investigations and the broader scholarly discourse is around applications. In addition to the potential impacts on society, these technologies create risks, which even in the corporate context are not easily identified or evaluated and therefore cannot be easily addressed. The risks are both upside risks (opportunities or rewards) and downside risks (exposures that jeopardize the company). Can these risks be identified and evaluated? If so, what models might work for evaluating and perhaps even optimizing risk? In this study, we will first explore what technologies are being deployed and where the organizational risk is being considered or evaluated from a governance perspective within the organization. Based on interviews with executives facing these new environments, we developed the over-arching research questions: What theories guide our thinking best in terms of developing risk optimization models? What might these risk models look like? The research involved an exploration using a survey instrument and multiple qualitative methods involving business leaders from companies deploying these technologies as well as the development and preliminary testing of three different risk optimization models using scenario analysis data. Based on this analysis, we developed the foundations for a risk model executives could use to consider these technologies. © 2019 IEEE.","AI; blockchain; Cyber Risk; Cyber security; distributed ledger; emerging technologies; IoT; Risk","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Instrument testing; Internet of things; Optimization; Risk management; Risk perception; Risks; Well testing; Corporate contexts; Cyber security; distributed ledger; Emerging technologies; Internet of thing (IOT); Qualitative method; Research questions; Survey instruments; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072600666

However, establishing such infrastructure can be exceptionally intricate due to the vast variety of devices and the implemented technologies. Also, it poses several unique challenges, such as heterogeneity of the infrastructure, type, and scale of deployment, security, privacy, and inter-operability. One primary concern in a smart city environment is the capabilities of typically end-IoT devices which are vulnerable to security threats and prone to confidentiality and integrity breach of data. Blockchain can potentially address these security challenges due to the distributed ledger's inherent properties. In this paper, we propose a decentralized architecture using the Blockchain to provide a secure and resilient smart city infrastructure that can run the ledger service over a distributed network. We consider a permissioned Blockchain, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and to automate and to overcome the infrastructural challenges concerning the smart city deployment, and we provide a systematic methodology that automates the deployment process and saves a significant amount of time. We simulate and deploy a Blockchain-integrated smart city environment using the proposed seamless deployment strategy using our automation module. With the proposed deployment scheme, we improve the Blockchain-based infrastructure development time by 82% compared to the traditional deployment approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Decentralized Deployment; Hyperledger Sawtooth; Smart City","Blockchain; Computer aided software engineering; Internet of things; Cyber infrastructures; Decentralized architecture; Decentralized Deployment; Distributed networks; Hyperledger Sawtooth; Infrastructure development; Operational efficiencies; Systematic methodology; Smart city",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073032407

We describe two approaches for utilizing blockchains and smart contracts in the authorization process: in the first approach, only hashes of the authorization information are recorded on the blockchain. In the second approach, a smart contract handles authorization requests. We implement the approaches using the OAuth 2.0 delegated authorization framework and evaluate the implementations on the public Ethereum testnet Rinkeby, in terms of execution cost, contract creation cost, and delay.

Nevertheless, security issues concerning how different healthcare providers exchange healthcare information have caused a flop in the deployment of such systems. The ability to exchange data securely is important so that new borderless integrated healthcare services can be provided to patients. Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology is a suitable driver for the much-needed shift towards integrated healthcare, providing new insights and addressing some of the main challenges of many healthcare areas. Blockchain allows healthcare providers to record and manage peer-to-peer transactions through a network without central authority. In this paper, we discuss the concept of blockchain technology and hurdles in their adoption in the healthcare domain. Furthermore, a review is conducted on the latest implementations of blockchain technology in healthcare. Finally, a new case study of a blockchain-based healthcare platform is presented addressing the drawbacks of current designs, followed by recommendations for future blockchain researchers and developers. © 2019 by the authors.

One interesting deployment scenario includes PUFs as random key generators. The deterministic nature of their operation alleviates the necessity to store the keys in non-volatile means. Along the same lines, blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data once stored while their overall security depends on the quality and secrecy of users' keys.

Due to the nature of the treatment and side effects on regular lifestyles, maintaining quality of life in the home environment is a challenging task. Sometimes within a home environment, a cancer patient's situation changes abruptly, as the functionality of certain organs deteriorate, which affects their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain and off-chain based framework which will allow multiple medical and ambient intelligent IoT sensors to capture quality of life information from one's home environment and securely share it with one's community of interest. Using our proposed framework, both transactional records and multimedia big data - consisting of a user's physiological as well as mental states - can be shared with an oncologist or palliative care unit for real-time decision support.

The supply chain industry represents a prominent and very promising application scenario for blockchain to enable transparency among untrusted stakeholders as well as increased efficiency and traceability throughout production and distribution processes, however there is a lack of empirical research available in that field. The primary purpose of this research is to address that research gap by exploring the application of blockchain technologies in supply chains. First, this research examines recent literature to identify current inefficiencies in existing supply chain information technologies. Secondly, key features of blockchain are identified to provide a clear understanding of the technology. Thirdly, current applications are documented and categorized to identify where blockchain applications can have the most impact on the three flows of the supply chain. The analysis shows most of the process areas in supply chain that blockchain is expected to improve are informational, which given the large amount of interdependencies between flows, has a positive impact on the subsequent financial and material flows. Finally, recommendations for future research are given to address further research questions. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Internet of Things; Supply Chain","Internet of things; Supply chains; Application scenario; Distribution process; Emerging technologies; Empirical research; Financial industry; Literature reviews; Research questions; Supply chain flows; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073889349

Deployment projects in various parts of the world are setting up Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) to support the security and privacy aspects on vehicular communications. While the use of PKI is a known technology to build a security framework for C-ITS and Connected Vehicles deployments and it will provide the basic needed services for integrity and authentication, research communities around the world are exploring extensions of these frameworks to implement specific functions like misbehavior detection and revocation. In addition, new techniques to mitigate privacy risks in vehicular networks are explored. In this paper, we address these aspects by proposing the use of blockchain in combination with a zone keys concept where the authorization certificates produced by the PKI are provided to the vehicles only if specific conditions stored in the blockchain are valid. We show how the concepts described in this paper can enhance the PKI-based frameworks through an efficient revocation mechanism, and mitigating privacy risks as well. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Integrity; Trust management; Vehicular networks","Blockchain; C (programming language); Cooperative communication; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet of things; Motor transportation; Public key cryptography; Traffic control; Vehicles; Authorization certificates; Integrity; Intelligent transport systems; Misbehavior detection; Public-key infrastructure; Trust management; Vehicular communications; Vehicular networks; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073891414

However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; Electric vehicles (evs); Proof of reputation (por); Vehicular energy network (ven); Wireless power transfer","Blockchain; Electric vehicles; Energy transfer; Inductive power transmission; Charging/discharging; Consensus protocols; Conventional schemes; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy networks; Proof of reputation (por); Security vulnerabilities; Wireless power transfer; Network security",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067334318

The benefits of UTXO representation include parallel processing, privacy, etc. However, the increasing size of UTXO set is degrading the access performance and severely brings down the validation speed of blockchain further, especially in resource-constrained scenerios, such as IoT. In this paper, we present a memory-economical storage system for UTXO-based blockchain. Based on the inherent properties of UTXO set, we propose two lossless compression techniques to reduce the memory space occupied by UTXO set. Besides, the database related operations are adopted to make the proposed mechanism easily applied in current blockchain system. Taking Bitcoin as the object of study, our mechanism can deliver 2.9-4.5x memory reduction and orders of magnitude validation speed improvement in resource-constrained situations. This compact system will improve validation performance and extend applied scope of blockchains. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Compact system; Lossless compression techniques; Memory reduction; Memory space; Orders of magnitude; Parallel processing; Speed improvement; Storage systems; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070920152

However, collection and distribution of RFID data are subject to various security concerns. RFID middleware systems are likely to suffer from parameter manipulation and eavesdropping, raising privacy concerns. Most recent works focus on access control schemes with models based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). These schemes, to enhance the security and privacy, are based on centralized models. In this paper, we present an ABAC model using chaincode in RFID systems. Our ABAC system is based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain, which is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains. Our ABAC model uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the ABAC model in order to ensure the security of RFID systems.

Since the number of ""things"" is expected to soon surpass human population, control and automation of IoT devices has received considerable attention from academia and industry. Cross-platform collaboration is highly desirable for better user experience due to fragmentation of user needs and vendor products with time. Centralized approaches have been used to build federated trust among platforms and devices, but limit diversity and scalability. We propose a decentralized trust framework, called IoT Passport, for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain technology. IoT Passport is motivated by the familiar use of passports for international travel but with greater dynamism. It enables platforms to establish arbitrary trust relations with each other containing specific rules for intended collaborations, enforced by a combination of smart contracts. Each interaction among devices is signed by the participants and recorded on the blockchain. The records are utilized as attributes for authorization and as proofs of incentive plans. This approach incorporates the preferences of participating platforms and end users, and opens new avenues for collaborative edge computing as well as research on blockchain-based access control mechanism for IoT environments. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Access control; Blockchain; Internet of things; Trust framework","Access control; Blockchain; Open access; Trusted computing; Access control mechanism; Centralized approaches; Control and automation; Human population; International travel; Internet of Things (IOT); Trust frameworks; Vendor products; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067205375

Privacy security remain a challenge owing to the existing systems being centralized - creating a single point of failure. In this paper, we lay out an architecture for incorporating a concept similar to Blockchain - the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to provide decentralized security and privacy for IoT devices. Currently, the issue with most IoT devices is that they lack the processing power, storage and computational overhead to run consensus algorithms to be an active part of the Blockchain network. The current issue with the blockchain on the other hand, is its low scalability and low number of transactions per second. We present an innovative approach using a technology called IOTA. This addresses some of the most important problems with existing blockchain infrastructure such as being able to run on lightweight devices with constrained memory. We eliminate transaction fees and the concept of mining which requires a large amount of processing power to compete with other miners. IOTA's main component is the Tangle, a guided acyclic graph (DAG) for transaction storage. We discuss creation of two IoT applications on the tangle - a smart utility meter system and a smart car transaction system which are connected to internet through Low Power Wide Area IoT networks. © 2019 IEEE.","blockchain; IoT security; LPWAN; smart meter; smart toll system; Tangle","Blockchain; Electronic money; Low power electronics; Signal processing; Smart meters; Toll highways; Wide area networks; Communication models; Computational overheads; Innovative approaches; Internet of thing (IOT); IoT security; LPWAN; Tangle; Toll system; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066881275

Only standard cryptographic primitives such as signatures and hash functions were used to achieve security. Though other cryptocurrencies such as Bit-gold and B-money which are among the authority-free cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the first one to experience public acceptance on a large scale. There are various factors which contribute to Bitcoins success, though there is still a little question of doubt that the decentralized design of blockchain technology and perceived resilience to government or third-party intervention played an extremely crucial role in its uptake.

However, a non-financial application, whose security requirements are less demanding, requires faster operation and so PoW is not suitable for many of the commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Trust-dependent Consensus scheme (TCON) for a blockchain based IoT access control framework. TCON ensures that the blocks are added at a faster rate, spending minimal energy compared to PoW based systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the notion of trust is quantified and used as a means to simplify the consensus problem in blockchain. A comparison of the various metrics to understand the differences in overhead involved suggest that the proposed scheme outperforms other non-trust-based consensus schemes. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Access control; Commercial applications; Consensus algorithms; Consensus problems; Consensus schemes; Control framework; Financial applications; Minimal energy; Security requirements; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066484397

However, blockchain together with data encryption technique enables the trustless network due to the tamper-proof, anonymity and unbreakable properties. Nevertheless, there are still some shortages when combining blockchain with IoT systems, for example the storage consumption. Generally speaking, validation nodes in blockchain network need to store a complete copy of the ledger so as to verify transactions and reach the whole network consensus.

How to encourage the willingness to cooperate and share information between these entities has always been one of the major challenges in the field of supply chain management. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can help entities get real-time data in the supply chain to share the key information and reduce costs. However, the supply chain not only needs to know how to gather the data but also ensures that the data processed is not leaked. Since Blockchain, as the main technology of Bitcoin, has the advantages of traceability and anti-counterfeiting, blockchain is the right tool to tackle the date sharing problem in supply chain. In this paper, we connect IIoT devices to the blockchain by combining the monitoring and recording of IIoT devices and storing real-time data in the network by smart contract. In addition, a blockchain-based supply chain structure is proposed. This structure provides collaboration solutions between different entities in the supply chain. In this structure, a fine-grained data sharing scheme for supply chain is proposed. By setting access policies to the smart contract, only the companies that satisfy the attributes of access policies can execute the smart contract and view the details of the transaction. The proposed scheme ensures reliability of data in the supply chain, and the privacy protection of the chain. © 2019 IEEE.","Attribute-based Encryption; Blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things; Smart Contract; Supply chain","Cryptography; Embedded systems; Information dissemination; Internet of things; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Technology transfer; Access policies; Anti-counterfeiting; Attribute-based encryptions; Fine grained; Privacy protection; Real-time data; Reduce costs; Supply chain structures; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070874364

Although the IoT evolution led to quality of life enhancement, many of its devices are insecure. The lack of robust key management systems, efficient identity authentication, low fault tolerance, and many other issues lead IoT devices into being easily targeted by attackers. The aim of this research is to enhance an authentication protocol that helps in the authentication process of IoT devices and CPANs (Personal Area Network Coordinators) in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. To propose a solution for this issue, and to find out the optimal contribution, a comparison and analysis on the current IoT security solutions have been conducted. Based on the analysis, it is found that the superior solution was a Blockchain-based solution called BCTrust. In this paper, the aim is to improve the basis authentication protocol adopted by BCTrust. The protocol is to be improved mainly by two sides, firstly, eliminating the blacklisting mechanism that can be leveraged by attackers to negatively impact the network. Secondly, introducing a new way for generating the identifiers of the IIoT devices. This would enhance the security and efficiency of BCTrust, specifically in the generation of IIoT secret keys. © 2019 IEEE.","Authentication; coordinator; Industrial IoT; Internet of Things; sensor","Authentication; Fault tolerance; Industrial research; Internet protocols; Personal communication systems; Sensors; Authentication protocols; Comparison and analysis; coordinator; Identity authentication; Industrial IoT; Internet of thing (IOT); Management protocols; Robust key management; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073888892

The use of Blockchain technology provides an answer to this issue, however, its application raises issues related to the highly-constrained nature of these networks.

The solution proposed by most of the researchers and industries is to converge the IoT ecosystem with the technology underlying the most secure cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is called as Blockchain. A blockchain in short is an immutable distributed ledger system. It enables the IoT devices to have data security and privacy without needing a central authority. This paper studies what are the issues IoT ecosystem is currently facing and how a blockchain can help to solve it, the relevance of blockchain-IoT convergence, and the areas where this can be applied.

However, these desirable benefits are gained if data from IoT networks are dependable-this is where blockchain comes into play. In fact, through blockchain, critical IoT data may be trusted, i.e., considered valid for any subsequent processing. A simple formal model named ""the Mirror Model"" is proposed to connect IoT data organized in traditional models to assets of trust in a blockchain. The Mirror Model sets some formal conditions to produce trusted data that remain trusted over time. A possible practical implementation of an application programming interface (API) is proposed, which keeps the data and the trust model in synch. Finally, it is noted that the Mirror Model enforces a top-down approach from reality to implementation instead of going the opposite way as it is now the practice when referring to blockchain and the IoT. © 2019 by the authors.","API gateway; Blockchain; IoT; IoT data dependability; IoT security; Mirror Model; Representation and trust models","Application programming interfaces (API); Blockchain; Mirrors; Security of data; Internet of thing (IOT); IoT data dependability; IoT security; Mirror model; Security vulnerabilities; Top down approaches; Traditional models; Trust models; Internet of things",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065919829

We define that the caching servers can be divided into the data loading caches for caching the received wireless IoT data and the data transmission caches for transmitting the IoT data into the blockchain based cloud caching servers. The blocks generated in the data loading caches at each access point will be written into the blockchain based on both the proof-of-work and the capacity of the data loading caches at each access point. Then, we formulate the optimization problem maximizing the system energy efficiency by optimizing the allocation of cache, computation and communication resources by a geometric programming model. By the CVX tool in matlab software, the geometric programming model can be solved effectively. We study the impact of different parameters involved in the blockchain on the system performance, and verify the effectiveness of our proposed energy efficiency aware optimization mechanism in the blockchain based IoT. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Blockchain; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Mathematical programming; MATLAB; Communication resources; Distributed storage; Geometric programming; Internet of Things (IOT); Multiple servers; Optimization problems; Telecom operators; Transaction process; Loading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070220939

The emerging Blockchain technology has provided a promising opportunity to break information island and single-domain management in multi-domain IoT systems by leveraging distributed storage. On the other hand, the transaction consensus throughput in the mainstream blockchain systems, such as Ethereum and Fabric, is far from meeting the demand for massive data storage in time in multi-domain IoT systems. In this paper, we design a sharding protocol called MDIoTSP. The protocol first partitions the overall blockchains into many small shards, each of which generally recognized as a micro-blockchain according to the multiple domains, and then make the final consensus by merging the hash digests of the sub-blocks which generated from the shards for the multi-domain IoT blockchains ecosystem specifically. We also develop MicrothingsChains to run MDIoTSP in multi-domain IoT blockchains to prove our assumption that MDIoTSP scales up the transaction consensus throughput near linearly with the number of shards. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Blockchain; Digital storage; Information management; Cross industry; Distributed storage; Industrial systems; Information island; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi domains; Multiple domains; Single domains; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070207155

However, realizing a fair and transparent supply chain system remains a very challenging issue due to the lack of mutual trust among the suppliers and merchants. Furthermore, the current system often lacks the ability to transmit trade information to all participants in a timely manner, which is the most important element in supply chain management for the effective supply of goods between suppliers and the merchants. This paper presents a blockchain-based supply chain management system in the IIoT. The proposed system takes advantage of blockchain technology in terms of its transparency and tamper-proof nature to support fair goods exchange between merchants and suppliers. Additionally, the decentralization and pseudonymity property will play a significant role in preserving the privacy of participants in the blockchain. In particular, fairness in the IIoT is first defined. Then, a design for a smart contract for fair goods exchange is presented to prevent malicious behavior through imposing penalties.

Due to the sensitivity of patient data, preserving the privacy of patients appears to be challenging. In healthcare applications, patient data are usually stored in the cloud, which makes it difficult for the users to have enough control over their data. However, due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is the data subject's right to know where and how his data has been stored, who can access his data and to what extent. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based architecture for e-health applications which provides an efficient privacy-preserving access control mechanism. We take advantage of Blockchain (BC) special features, i.e., immutability and anonymity of users, while modifying the classic blockchain structure in order to overcome its challenges in IoT applications (i.e., low throughput, high overhead and latency). To this end, we cluster the miners of BC, store and process data at the nearest cluster to the patient.

Misbehaving routers affect the availability of the networks by dropping packets selectively and rejecting data forwarding services. Although existing Reputation Management (RM) systems are useful in identifying misbehaving routers, the centralized nature of the RM center has the risk of one-point failure. The emerging blockchain techniques, with the inherent decentralized consensus mechanism, provide a promising method to reduce this one-point failure risk. By adopting the distributed consensus mechanism, we propose a blockchain-based reputation management system in IoT networks to overcome the limitation of centralized router RM systems. The proposed solution utilizes the blockchain technique as a decentralized database to store router reports for calculating reputation of each router. With the proposed reputation calculation mechanism, the reliability of each router would be evaluated, and the malicious misbehaving routers with low reputations will be blacklisted and get isolated. More importantly, we develop an optimized group mining process for blockchain technique in order to improve the efficiency of block generation and reduce the resource consumption. The simulation results validate the distributed blockchain-based RM system in terms of attacks detection and system convergence performance, and the comparison result of the proposed group mining process with existing blockchain models illustrates the applicability and feasibility of the proposed works. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Distributed reputation management; IoT; Routing protection","Blockchain; Data mining; Convergence performance; Decentralized consensus; Decentralized database; Distributed consensus; Internet of Things (IOT); Reputation management; Routing misbehaviors; Routing protection; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070290028

In this paper, we study the D2D communication resource allocation scheme based on sparse code multiple access (SCMA). Firstly, the system's interference model and block-chain-based transaction flow are analyzed.

Contemporary IoT and enterprise deployments widely use the publish-subscribe messaging model because of its resource-efficiency. However, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a centralized architecture, wherein the data from all the publishers in the application network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a centralized architecture makes the publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to Byzantine failures. For example, it provides an opportunity for the organization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we contribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with Byzantine fault-tolerance and blockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of the brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network, and stores the data in an immutable ledger through the use of blockchain technology. Through the use of consensus protocols and distributed ledger technology, Trinity can guarantee ordering, fault-tolerance, persistence and immutability across trust boundaries.Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal resources. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the first framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with the publish-subscribe messaging model. Furthermore, we plan to use Trinity in a real-world use case for increasing the transparency of racial profiling. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Broker; IoT; Ledger; Multi-stakeholder; Smart Contract; Supply Chain Monitoring","Blockchain; Chromium compounds; Electronic data interchange; Electronic money; Fault tolerance; Message passing; Network architecture; Publishing; Supply chains; Broker; Byzantine fault tolerance; Centralized architecture; Distributed applications; Internet of Things (IOT); Ledger; Multi-stakeholder; Publish-subscribe systems; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069224000

The GS1, a non-profit international standard organization, standardized an Object Name Service (ONS) which enables users to manage and discover services in the midst of tremendous amounts of service. However, it has a vulnerability in security and fault tolerance of providing service, because the ONS operates based on the DNS protocol. It is weak against data tampering attacks caused by DNS cache poisoning, spoofing, and local DNS cracking. It has a weak fault tolerance from problems with attack or malfunction.

The BlockONS consists of new service data modeling for an off-chain scaling, data tampering validation method, and fault tolerance mechanism. We designed the BlockONS into two parts: A BlockONS Node part to valid data tampering, and a BlockONS Agent part for scaling and fault tolerance.

As such, the secondary user can send its sensing data, i.e., transactions, to the mining pools. After being verified by miners, the transactions are added to the blocks. However, under the dynamics of the primary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it is challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction transmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the secondary user.

As we step into the era where 'data is termed as new oil', there is a need for protocols with support for selling and buying data without giving up the data ownership to third-parties. In this demo, we present Streaming Data Payment Protocol (SDPP), which is an application layer protocol for selling and buying data. SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment.

Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Blockchain; Certificate authority; Cloud; Public key infrastructure; Smart contract","Blockchain; Clouds; Public key cryptography; Certificate authority; Certificate revocation list; Cloud providers; Cloud-based; Data storage; Public key infrastructure; Traffic securities; Transaction data; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065912183

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical and scalable blockchain-based secure metering system, SMChain, to provide strong security, trustworthy guarantee, and immutable services. SMChain adopts a two-layer blockchain structure, consisting of independent local blockchains stored at individual plants and one state blockchain stored in the cloud. To deal with the scalability issues within each plant, we propose a novel scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol based on (k, n)-threshold signature scheme to deal with the Byzantine faults and reduce the intra-plant communication complexity from O(n2) to O(n).

Blockchain-based overlay networks have been developed to provide such financial mechanism for IoT devices with sufficient processing power and operating system support. However, no practical solutions for low-end devices exist. In addition, existing solutions also require setting up multiple blockchain accounts for a single administrative domain, which incurs high fees when consolidating those accounts.

Recently, these types of systems are evolved into cognitive peer-to-peer networks. Because of the distributed nature of Internet of Things (IoT), peer-to-peer systems such as blockchain can be used to design management mechanisms in IoT. Therefore, we need an architecture which facilitates the utilization of peer-to-peer systems in IoT based systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general architecture based on cognitive peer-to-peer networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an architecture for managing IoT based on cognitive peer-to-peer networks. In order to study the potential of the proposed architecture, we suggest an adaptive search mechanism and also a topology management algorithm utilizing the proposed architecture.

However, keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g., state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction of the amount of information transmitted in downlink from the wireless base station to the IoT device. A potential application of the proposed scheme is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In the conclusion, this paper is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design of lightweight blockchain protocols with wireless connectivity. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; data structures; Internet of Things (IoT)","Blockchain; Data structures; Network architecture; Signal to noise ratio; Amount of information; Constrained devices; Decentralized architecture; Internet of Things (IOT); Low signal-to-noise ratio; Software implementation; Wireless base stations; Wireless connectivities; Internet of things",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065611108

In a mobile and federated context, selecting reliable partners for cooperation is a complex task because the most part of devices are not referenced with respect to their trustworthiness. The aggregation of agents in groups, in each IoT environment, on the basis of reputation information can provide a solution to this problem. In order to spread device/agent reputation information in our distributed scenario without using a central repository, we propose to rely on the blockchain technology to support a reputation approach to form groups.

With this increased use of new technologies, the security problem is becoming more and more important because complex systems lead to unpredictable security vulnerabilities, which result in financial and private information losses. As a recently emerged technology, Blockchain was emerged as an alternative solution to security breaches of a different application environment. In contrast to the central structure used by most systems, it is preferred especially in the area of security by its distributed structure and the cryptographic hash algorithm it uses. Today, structures such as Smart Home, Smart City, Smart Environment and Smart Agriculture, which are created by using IoT are seen as active research areas with more security shortages. The reason for the security weakness in these areas arises from the hardware restriction on the IoT devices used. In the proposed system, an authorization system for IoT devices has been tried to be set up by using the distributed node structure of Blockchain system and blocks kept in these nodes.

Unfortunately, some of these devices are of questionable security, becoming targets of choice for numerous exploits. This can result in compromising the home network, as well as large scale attacks such as the recent Mirai network of botnets that was used in a DDoS attack. The problem is that end users have a hard time assessing the risks induced by connected devices, and often lack the skills and time to administrate their home network. We answer the above challenge by proposing STewARD, a solution that allows users to easily request from their intelligent home network controller the creation of isolated software-defined network slices, to which they assign a required trust level using very simple risk assessment. We build a global trust assessment framework that computes a trust score for each class of devices, based on reported history stored in a blockchain. Network controllers can then leverage this information to connect to slices only those devices that meet the expected trust levels, and can contribute to the crowd-sourced reporting by monitoring the devices' behaviors compared to an expected baseline. © 2019 IEEE.","Access Control; Blockchain; Distributed Ledger; Home networking; Internet of Things; Risk management; Security; Software-Defined Networking; Trust","Access control; Blockchain; Denial-of-service attack; Internet of things; Network security; Personal communication systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Software defined networking; Distributed Ledger; Home Networking; Intelligent home network; Internet of thing (IOT); Large-scale attacks; Security; Trust; Trust assessments; Home networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073250918

A centralized data exchange is not desirable as it leads to a single performance bottleneck. Although a distributed data exchange removes the central bottleneck, it has network performance issues as data passes among multiple coordinators. A decentralized approach is the only solution that fully enables the realization of efficient IoT systems, since there is no single performance bottleneck and network overhead is minimized. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages the semantics of DX-MAN for realizing decentralized data flows in IoT systems. The algebraic semantics of such a model allows a well-defined structure of data flows which is easily analyzed by an algorithm that forms a direct relationship between data consumers and data producers. For the analysis, the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that DX-MAN separates control flow and data flow. Thus, our approach prevents passing data alongside control among multiple coordinators, so data is only read and written on a decentralized data space. We validate our approach using smart contracts on the Blockchain, and conducted experiments to quantitatively evaluate scalability. The results show that our approach scales well with the size of IoT systems. © 2019 IEEE.","algebraic service composition; Blockchain; decentralized data flows; DX-MAN; exogenous connectors; Internet of Things; scalability; separation between control and data","Algebra; Blockchain; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Electronic data interchange; Scalability; Semantics; Algebraic semantic; Data flow; Decentralized approach; DX-MAN; Internet of thing (IOT); Performance bottlenecks; Service compositions; Well-defined structures; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073198237

A typical keenly intellective home includes many Internet of things contrivances that engender processes and immensely colossal data to efficiently handle its users’ demands. This incrementing demand raises a plethora of concern cognate to a smart home system in terms of scalability, efficiency, and security. All these issues are tedious to manage, and the existing studies lack the granularity for surmounting them. Considering such a requisite of security and efficiency as a quandary at hand, this article presents a secure and efficient smart home architecture, which incorporates the blockchain and the cloud computing technologies for a cumulated solution. Because of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, it can serve the processing services and make the transaction copy of the collected sensible user data from smart home. To ensure the security of smart home network, our proposed model utilizes the multivariate correlation analysis technique to analyze the network traffic and identify the correlation between traffic features.

Based on the proposed solution, an experiment with 40 Home Nodes is conducted to prove the concepts. From the results, we find that our solution provides a high transaction speed and scalability, as well as good performance on security and micropayment which are important in IoT settings.

Data protection and privacy is one of the key challenges in the Internet of Things technology. Dangers involved in the centralized technology of Blockchain system have led to the idea of using Tangle, which is a decentralized system. The main purpose of this new technology is to improve the problems and limitations of Blockchain such as high cost and time to confirm a transaction. In this new architecture, every node is involved in maintaining network security. This way, if a transaction is created, then it should select and confirm two unconfirmed transactions issued before. A walking algorithm is needed for this selection. Walking algorithms presented in literature thus far are either weighted or unweighted. An unweighted random walk algorithm can approve transactions nearly proportional to the time of their arrivals while a weighted algorithm can better defend against lazy and malicious transactions. In this paper, a new random walk algorithm is presented that has the benefits of both algorithms at the same time. The idea is to adapt the weight value to the current situation of transactions. Numerical results have shown the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the existing algorithms in providing a balance between timeliness of approving transactions and protecting against malicious activities. © 2019 IEEE.","blockchain; internet of things; tangle; walking algorithm","Blockchain; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Random processes; Adaptive random walks; Decentralized system; Internet of things technologies; Malicious activities; Malicious transaction; Random walk algorithms; tangle; Weighted algorithm; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069940144

The edge devices in a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors. Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.","Consensus algorithm; cyber-physical systems (CPSs); data gathering; Internet of Things (IoT); security events detection","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Lunar surface analysis; Process monitoring; Consensus algorithms; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Data gathering; Internet of Things (IOT); Security events; Iterative methods",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065618125

In the connected and automated supply chains of the industry 4.0, even more nodes are incorporated in supply chains. This paper discusses the possible improvement of process quality in the industry 4.0 through the different blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. We derived hypotheses from a literature review and asked German blockchain experts from the industry to validate and discuss the hypotheses. We find that the different blockchain technologies and consensus algorithms have different strength with regard to quality improvement. One central finding is that IOTA, developed especially for the IoT and deemed the 'next evolutionary step' is scalable and hence may increases the process efficiency, but at the same time is more vulnerable than other blockchain implementations, which again may reduce the overall process quality. © 2019 IEEE.","blockchain; industrial IoT; industry 4.0; process quality","Blockchain; Industry 4.0; Supply chains; Automated supply chain; Consensus algorithms; Customer networks; industrial IoT; Literature reviews; Process efficiency; Process quality; Quality improvement; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072946975

However, Blockchain technology is more universal and can be used also in other areas, for example, in IoT, WSN and mobile devices.This paper considers the implementation of Blockchain technology in sensor networks as an element of IoT. The concept of Rolling Blockchain was proposed, which can be used to build WSN with the participation of Smart Cars, as nodes of the network.The order of block formation and structure in the chain is proposed and a mathematical model is created for it.

However, cloud computing exists some inherent weakness, such as data loss and leakage, threats to data privacy, etc. We propose a blockchain-based MEC platform, called BlockMEC, that consists of unknown devices to distribute computing, control, storage, and networking functions to the edge of network without involving any central controllers.

With IoT devices having to execute thousands of operations per second, it has become difficult for centralized systems to handle such platforms. Also, factors like operational and maintenance cost of these server machines and danger of DoS(Denial of Service) attack on such servers has threatened the practitioners to come up with a more distributed way of storing the contents. With its decentralized and privacy preserving features, blockchain technology fits well into the scheme of things. This mitigates the quintessential challenges faced in most of the centralized systems. In this paper, we are focusing on the new firmware update scheme to perform the update operations securely. We propose a blockchain based solution for managing firmware updates in IoT. Improper management of devices and distribution of firmware updates from the device vendor could sabotage the IoT ecosystem. The objective of this proposed scheme is to verify and distribute the firmware binaries securely to the IoT device deployed by the device vendor. The PUSH-based method is used for a firmware update in which verification of firmware is done by Hash Chain. It preserves the integrity of firmware by linking the latest version information by previous versions information with the help of a smart contract mechanism. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Firmware Update; Internet of Things; Smart Contracts","Blockchain; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Firmware; Centralized systems; Denial of Service; Firmware updates; Internet of thing (IOT); Maintenance cost; Privacy preserving; Server machines; Version information; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067921371

Traditional intrusion detection systems do not serve the network environment of the IoT very well, so it is important to study intrusion detection systems suitable for the network environment of the Internet of Things. Researchers have found that the combination of machine learning technologies with an intrusion detection system is an effective way to resolve the drawbacks traditional IDSs have when they are used for IoT. This research involves the design of a novel intrusion detection system and the implementation and evaluation of its analysis model. This new intrusion detection system uses a hybrid placement strategy based on a multi-agent system. The new system consists of a data collection module, a data management module, an analysis module and a response module. For the implementation of the analysis module, this research applies a deep neural network algorithm for intrusion detection. The results demonstrate the efficiency of deep learning algorithms for detecting attacks from the transport layer.

Only when trust from the digital domain is extended to the physical domain can the movement of goods be accurately traced (e.g., for callbacks and provenance) and product authenticity determined.

The aim is to support humans in optimizing risk of supply chains for industrial manufacturing and service provisioning in a timely manner. The ultimate aim is sustainability. The problem for deciding on authentication is probably imperfect information on compliance. Its asymmetric implications of the meaning of contracts for secure information sharing may cause vulnerability of data breach and misuse. A traditional way to avoid harm of that asymmetry requires authentic and consistent sharing of audit information on violation of a certification policy to a centralized audit intelligence. This information sharing is, however, subject to the problem of single point of failure of the centralized audit intelligence. With our work on Security by Design, we show a non-central approach of clarifying accountability to reduce the risk caused by asymmetric implications of the meaning of contracts on authentication. Our signaling and screening scheme SK4SC provides personal digital evidences on compliance to multilateral policies on using information or in other words on trustworthiness. Blockchains are used to realize their symmetric distribution while users share risk on accountability with competition on incentives in a privacy-enhancing manner.

The recent, exponential rise in adoption of the most disparate Internet of Things (IoT) devices and technologies has reached also Water supply chains, drumming up substantial research and innovation interest towards developing reliable, auditable and transparent traceability systems. Current IoT-based traceability and provenance systems for water supply chains are built on top of centralized infrastructures and this leaves room for unsolved issues and major concerns, including data integrity, tampering and single points of failure. Blockchains, the distributed ledger technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, represent a new and innovative technological approach to realizing decentralized trustless systems. This will also eliminate corruption due to unmaintained record of sources. Indeed, the inherent properties of this digital technology provide fault-tolerance, immutability, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction records, as well as coherent digital representations of physical assets and autonomous transaction executions. This paper presents Aqua-chain, a fully decentralized, blockchain-based traceability solution for Water supply chain management, able to seamless integrate IoT devices producing and consuming digital data along the chain. To effectively assess Aqua-chain, first, we defined a classical use-case within the given vertical domain, namely from-supplier-to-buyer. Then, we developed and deployed such use-case, achieving traceability using blockchain implementation, Ethereum. Finally, we evaluated and compared the performance deployments, in terms of latency, CPU, and network usage, also highlighting its main pros and cons. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT); Economy; Government; Health; IoT; Water","Blockchain; Digital devices; Fault tolerance; Health; Information management; Internet of things; Water; Water supply; Digital representations; Digital technologies; Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT); Economy; Government; Internet of Things (IOT); Traceability systems; Transaction execution; Supply chain management",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072825753

In the literature on blockchains, it is found that most articles focused on their engineering implementation, while little attention has been devoted to the exploration of theoretical aspects of the system; however, the existing work is limited to model the mining process only. In this paper, a queuing theory-based model is proposed for understanding the working and theoretical aspects of the blockchain. We validate our proposed model using the actual statistics of two popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, by running simulations for two months of transactions. The obtained performance measures parameters such as the Number of Transactions per block, Mining Time of Each Block, System Throughput, Memorypool count, Waiting Time in Memorypool, Number of Unconfirmed Transactions in the Whole System, Total Number of Transactions, and Number of Generated Blocks; these values are compared with actual statistics. It was found that the results gained from our proposed model are in good agreement with actual statistics. Although the simulation in this paper presents the modeling of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies only, the proposed model can be used to represent a wide range of blockchain-based systems. © 2019, MDPI AG.

Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial process. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; cyber-physical systems; internet of things; logistics; p2p network; smart contract","Blockchain; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Logistics; Quality of service; Supply chains; Industrial monitoring; Industrial processs; Information generation; Internet of Things (IOT); Monitoring applications; P2P network; Specific problems; Use case scenario; Internet of things",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074640851

And blockchain-enabled internet of things (BIoT) has a tendency to make a revolutionary change for the internet of things (IoT) which requires distributed trustless consensus. However, the scalability and security issues become particularly important with the dramatically increasing number of IoT devices. Especially, with the development of quantum computing, many extant cryptographic algorithms applied in blockchain or BIoT systems are vulnerable to the quantum attacks. In this paper, an anti-quantum proxy blind signature scheme based on the lattice cryptography has been proposed, which can provide user anonymity and untraceability in the distributed applications of BIoT. Then, the security proof of the proposed scheme can derive that it is secure in random oracle model, and the efficiency analysis can indicate it is efficient than other similar literatures. © 2019 Tech Science Press.

A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed.

It effectively integrates the physical world with the Internet over existing network infrastructure to facilitate sharing data among intelligent devices. However, its complex and large-scale network structure brings new security risks and challenges to IoT systems. To ensure the security of data, traditional access control technologies are not suitable to be directly used for implementing access control in IoT systems because of their complicated access management and the lack of credibility due to centralization. In this paper, we proposed a novel attribute-based access control scheme for IoT systems, which simplifies greatly the access management. We use blockchain technology to record the distribution of attributes in order to avoid single point failure and data tampering. The access control process has also been optimized to meet the need for high efficiency and lightweight calculation for IoT devices. The security and performance analysis show that our scheme could effectively resist multiple attacks and be efficiently implemented in IoT systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Access control; attribute-based access control; blockchain; consortium blockchain; Internet of Things","Blockchain; Information management; Internet of things; Network security; Access control technologies; Attribute based access control; Intelligent devices; Internet of thing (IOT); Large-scale network; Network infrastructure; Security and performance; Single point failure; Access control",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065174375

Apart from enhanced network performance, a practical and reliable security scheme is needed to handle the trust management while preserving user privacy at the same time. The emerging 5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Furthermore, incorporating software-defined network (SDN) architecture into the 5G-VANET enables global information gathering and network control. Hence, real-time IoT services on transportation monitoring and reporting can be well supported. Both pave the way for an innovative vehicular security scheme. This paper investigates the security and privacy issue in the transportation system and the vehicular IoT environment in SDN-enabled 5G-VANET. Due to the decentralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain, a blockchain-based security framework is designed to support the vehicular IoT services, i.e., real-time cloud-based video report and trust management on vehicular messages. This paper explicitly illustrates the SDN-enabled 5G-VANET model and the scheduling procedures of the blockchain-based framework. The numerical simulation results also show that malicious vehicular nodes or messages can be well detected while the overhead and impact on the network performance are acceptable for large-scale scenarios.

These smart devices are now becoming socially conscious by following the social Internet of Things (SIoT) model that empowers them to create and maintain social relationships among them. The Social Internet of Vehicle (SIoV) is one application of SIoT in the vehicular domain that has evolved the existing intelligent transport system (ITS) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to the next phase of Intelligent by adding socializing aspect and constant connectivity. SIoV generates a massive amount of real-time data enriched with context and social relationship information about vehicles, drivers, passengers, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, the role of privacy management becomes essential in SIoV, as data is collected and stored at different layers of its architecture. The challenge of privacy is aggravated because the dynamic nature of SIoV poses a major threat in its adoption. Motivated by the need to address these aspects, this paper identifies the challenges involved in managing privacy in SIoV. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the privacy issues and factors that are essential to be considered for preserving privacy in SIoV environments from different perspectives including the privacy of a person, behavior and action, communication, data and image, thoughts and feelings, location and space, and association.

Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures.

In such an environment the average user is bound to face considerable difficulties in understanding the size and scope of his/her collected data. However, the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require data subjects to be able to control their personal data, be informed, and consent to its processing in an intelligible manner. This paper proposes ADVOCATE platform, a user-centric solution that allows data subjects to easily manage consents regarding access to their personal data in the IoT ecosystem. The proposed platform also assists data controllers to meet GDPR requirements, such as informing data subjects in a transparent and unambiguous manner about the data they will manage, the processing purposes, and periods. The integrity of personal data processing consents and the immutable versioning control of them are protected by a blockchain infrastructure. Finally, the paper provides a prototype implementation of the proposed platform that supports the main consents management functionality. © 2019 Konstantinos Rantos et al.",,"Blockchain; Data handling; Ecosystems; Consent managements; Data controllers; Data subjects; General data protection regulations; Internet of thing (IOT); Management functionality; Prototype implementations; User-centric; Internet of things",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074347402

Android devices and applications are working hand to hand to realize dreams of the IoT. Recently, there is a rapid increase in threats and malware attacks on Android-based devices. Moreover, due to extensive exploitation of the Android platform in the IoT devices creates a task challenging of securing such kind of malware activities. This paper presents a novel framework that combines the advantages of both machine learning techniques and blockchain technology to improve the malware detection for Android IoT devices. The proposed technique is implemented using a sequential approach, which includes clustering, classification, and blockchain. Machine learning automatically extracts the malware information using clustering and classification technique and store the information into the blockchain. Thereby, all malware information stored in the blockchain history can be communicated through the network, and therefore any latest malware can be detected effectively. The implementation of the clustering technique includes calculation of weights for each feature set, the development of parametric study for optimization and simultaneously iterative reduction of unnecessary features having small weights. The classification algorithm is implemented to extract the various features of Android malware using naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, the naive Bayes classifier is based on decision trees for extracting more important features to provide classification and regression for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Finally, our proposed framework uses the permissioned blockchain to store authentic information of extracted features in a distributed malware database blocks to increase the run-time detection of malware with more speed and accuracy, and further to announce malware information for all users. © 2019 IEEE.","Android malware detection; blockchain; clustering; Internet of Things (IoT); secure machine learning","Android (operating system); Blockchain; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Computer crime; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Internet of things; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Malware; Android malware; Classification algorithm; Classification technique; clustering; Clustering techniques; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning techniques; Naive Bayes classifiers; Mobile security",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066625960

Incorporation of IoT has brought the objects around us to life, making them 'smart' and capable of communicating with each other, thereby amassing massive data by constantly capturing the physical world, for analyzing and performing some intelligent action based on the same. It has made possible our dream of seamless integration of the digital and physical worlds, changing the very essence of our perception of the physical world. But, the problem with current IoT solutions is its need for a centralized party (like a cloud server), for connecting and communicating via the Internet, which poses a great threat to the privacy and security of the vast sensitive data being generated, whereas the original architecture design demands for a decentralized one like distributed or peer-to- peer (P2P) system. So, blockchain comes into play, providing a secure and trustworthy way of sharing information using a distributed/P2P model, to achieve transparency, security, privacy, auditability, resilience, access authentication, data immutability, etc. In this paper, we will look into how to combine both the technologies to overcome their shortcomings and obtain a greater gain from their benefits.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for integrity and privacy-preserving IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing technologies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial data. Moreover, access to user data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, users' data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution also conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Lastly, we present a system of reward in the form of a digital token “PrivyCoin” for the users for sharing their data with the stakeholders/third parties.

However, a product consumer has to implicitly trust the Smart Tag creator and other stakeholders within the supply chain that they are providing authentic data within a product's tag. The DL-Tags solution steps into this environment to offer a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable management of Smart Tags during a product's lifecycle. The solution is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and uses the Ethereum blockchain to mediate interactions between the stakeholders during a product's exchange process. By reaching a consensus on the product's description and state logged on the blockchain, all involved stakeholders and product consumers can verify the product's authenticity without revealing their identity.

In this paper, we present a framework for IoT that employs an edge computing layer of Fog nodes controlled and managed by an SDN network to achieve high reliability and availability for latency-sensitive IoT applications. The SDN network is equipped with distributed controllers and distributed resource constrained OpenFlow switches. Blockchain is used to ensure decentralization in a trustful manner. Additionally, a data offloading algorithm is developed to allocate various processing and computing tasks to the OpenFlow switches based on their current workload. Moreover, a traffic model is proposed to model and analyze the traffic indifferent parts of the network. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in simulation and in a testbed.

Although they are convenient, they may also be open to attack since physical access may not be needed. In addition, most frameworks use a centralized architecture to update a potentially large number of devices increasing the threat landscape. An alternative solution, that relies on a blockchain framework with smart contracts, is proposed in this paper to protect the integrity of the firmware update process. The proposed system is suitable for use in smart cities or scenarios with a large number of devices and service providers where nodes are authenticated, communications protected, and update conditions specified and enforced through smart contracts. A proof-of- concept system was implemented and tested using an open-source blockchain framework and a WiFi-capabable ESP8266-based board.

Various network attacks attempt to discover IDs that can be used in future attacks to obtain private information. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based user authentication approach that can be used by various end-users for internet of things (IoT) applications. The proposed approach uses single-use authentication parameters and does not require any private information. It is based on the child-key mechanism of the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet. The HD wallet is accepted as a standard of Bitcoin and is in turn based on the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. The authentication parameters of the proposed approach were created using the HD wallet mechanism. The transaction of the authentication key stored in the distributed ledgers of the blockchain could be shared by various IoT servers for subscription to different services, and the user account of the blockchain could be connected to the IoT servers for payments without a membership procedure. We used only hash values for an authentication request to protect against network attacks. The proposed approach could decrease the system load by using a lightweight feature with few parameters and simplify the approach without the need for additional procedures by IoT servers. We verified that the security requirements of the proposed approach were satisfied, by analyzing the transmitted parameters. Furthermore, we evaluated the security vulnerabilities from various threats and analyzed attack scenarios. Thus, we propose that the authentication servers verify an original EC domain parameter hash value and the hash reuse to protect against fake attacks by network sniffing and spoofing. We have also summarized the originality and the characteristics of the proposed research by comparing it with closely related studies and concluded with a future research guide. © BEIESP.","Authentication; Blockchain; Elliptic curve cryptosystem; Identity; Peer to peer; Privacy",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064600744

Pollutants such as harmful gases and fine dust generated in industrial sites are the main causes of air pollution. Strict control of emissions of air pollutants from industrial sites is required. In this paper, we propose a real-time air pollution index measurement platform using 5G wireless network and blockchain. The proposed platform breaks the existing passive method and collects data in real time through IoT sensor based on 5G wireless network. In order to prevent forgery and tampering of collected data, we use blockchain technology to encrypt and transmit to cloud and provide real-time air pollution index measurement platform. You can extract technology-intensive data through edge computing and cloud computing. This paper describes the architecture of the proposed platform and introduces use cases. © 2019 The Authors.

Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; consensus mechanism; Food traceability; Internet of Things; shelf life management","Blockchain; Computer circuits; Data transfer; Decision support systems; Food preservation; Food supply; Fuzzy logic; Quality assurance; Ships; Supply chains; Anti-counterfeiting; Decision supports; Food traceability systems; Food traceabilitys; Information accuracy; Shelf life; Supply chain network; System reliability; Internet of things",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075933670

These are not unaccustomed words anymore in our lives. Although the technologies are in the infancy step and are still many remaining technical challenges, there is no doubt that it will be one of the major parts of the future Internet. The efficiency and security of data transmission scheme have always been major issues in the legacy Internet, and a data transmission scheme for the future Internet, including 5G and IoT environment should also provide and support these issues. Consequently, we propose a new data transmission scheme to successfully support the future Internet environment. The proposed scheme, which is named as S-DTS (Secure Data Transmission Scheme), supports a distributed transmission and decentralized access control. The S-DTS utilizes 4 synchronization zones, which are IoT network zone, aggregation zone, mining zone, and management zone, and these zones are operated by the DPN (Delegated Proof of Node) mechanism. Furthermore, all nodes are categorized to the 3 node groups, LDTG (Low Delay Tolerance Group), MDTG (Medium Delay Tolerance Group), HDTG (High Delay Tolerance Group), to provide an efficient data transmission, and the data in each group will be transmitted in accordance with their own traffic attributes. The evaluation results of this scheme show that it is very suitable for massive IoT environment scenarios, and IoT devices can take advantage of safe and efficient transmission by using the delegated proof of node technique. In addition, the S-DTS might be adaptable for various computing and networking environment with big data, edge cloud and cloud computing, and autonomous networking.

A twophase encryption technique for encrypting question papers (QSPs) is proposed. In the first phase, QSPs are encrypted using a timestamp, and in the second phase, previously encrypted QSPs are encrypted again using a timestamp, salt hash, and hash from the previous QSPs. These encrypted QSPs are stored in a blockchain along with a smart contract that helps the user to unlock the selected QSP. An algorithm is also proposed for selecting a QSP for the exam that randomly picks a QSP. Moreover, a timestamp-based lock is imposed on the scheme so that no one can decrypt the QSP before the allowed time. Security analysis is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme against different attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through implementation, and the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing schemes is proven through a comparative study based on different features. © 2019, Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering.","Blockchain; Internet of things; Security; Smart education",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074035736

The popularity of blockchains was originated from the concept of crypto-currencies to serve as a decentralized and tamper-proof transaction data ledger. Nowadays, blockchains as the key framework in the decentralized public data-ledger have been applied to a wide range of scenarios far beyond crypto-currencies, such as the Internet of Things, healthcare, and insurance. This survey aims to fill the gap between a large number of studies on blockchain networks, where game theory emerges as an analytical tool, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the game theoretical approaches applied in blockchain-related issues. In this survey, we review the game models proposed to address common issues in the blockchain network. The focus is placed on security issues, e.g., selfish mining, majority attack and denial of service attack, issues regarding mining management, e.g., computational power allocation, reward allocation, and pool selection, as well as issues regarding blockchain economic and energy trading.

It is shown that the creation and function of the SCDF, compared to other supply chain management (SCM) class systems, raises a number of specific problems caused by the complexity of the interaction of raw material suppliers (fresh fruit), manufacturers of final products (drying, packaging), storage terminals, distributors, 3PL and 4PL providers (retailers). These problems are due to the fact that the interaction of participants in business processes in the SCDF generates a lot of material, financial and information flows, as well as flows of services from sources of raw materials to the final consumer. An important aspect of improving the performance of the SCDF is the development of methods and tools, and on their basis the applied information technology to ensure the reliability and security of the SCDF. To solve this problem, it was proposed to use the Blockchain technology to protect the telecommunication channels connecting the circuit elements from unauthorized access.

The current paradigm of “defense in depth” provides measures across the tiers of a network to monitor, detect, filter, and block adversary vectors to steal, exploit, or destroy information or systems. Defense in depth is built from additional hardware and software added at key nodes and by design no individual node is trusted but is also defended and checked. Supply Chain and Financial communities over the last 5 years have been experimenting with block chain technologies to combat their trust gap between suppliers and customers. Block chain, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence provide Big Data to commercial companies to optimize current supply chains and view real time situation reports. This paper studies the viability and benefits in cybersecurity of block chain boosted acquisitions for global computer networks and proposes military initiative to instigate block chain requirements in the invention stage of the product. Key attributes of these system of systems are developed into building a framework for a cost-effective implementation of block chain technologies across the current supply chain from material to assembly to delivery for each hardware device. Software trust is considered for an innovative twist to the block chain process that will give integrity to lines of code that come originally and continued for the lifecycle of the system.

The algorithm is built as an improvement for coral reefs optimization (CRO) using opposition-based learning (OBL). For efficient modeling as the main part of this work, a novel time series forecasting model called OCRO-multi-layer neural network (MLNN) is proposed to explore hidden relationships in the non-linear time series data. The model thus combines OCRO with MLNN for data processing, which enables reducing the model complexity by faster convergence than the traditional back-propagation algorithm. For validation of the proposed model, three real-world datasets are used, including Internet traffic collected from a private internet service provider (ISP) with distributed centers in 11 European cities, WorldCup 98 contains request numbers to the server in football world cup season in 1998, and Google cluster log dataset gathered from its data center. Through the carried out experiments, we demonstrated that with both univariate and multivariate data, the proposed prediction model gains good performance in accuracy, run time and model stability aspects as compared with other modern learning techniques like recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). In addition, with used real datasets, we intend to concentrate on applying OCROMLNN to distributed systems in order to enable the proactive resource allocation capability for e-infrastructures (e.g. clouds services, Internet of Things systems, or blockchain networks). © 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we thoroughly review and systematize all cryptographic concepts which are already used in blockchain. Additionally, we give a list of cryptographic concepts which have not yet been applied but have big potentials to improve the current blockchain solutions. We also include possible instantiations of these cryptographic concepts in the blockchain domain.

But sharing personal information, in the IoT era forces us to consider not only personal data, but also personal devices sharing. It becomes fundamental to consider users' awareness and centrality in the act of sharing, and resilience towards malicious third parties, which are problems that blockchain technologies are fit to solve. In order to make decentralized solutions usable for real, there is another challenge, the not simple compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Authority has provided, in order to implement protection of sensitive data in each EU member. Such regulation protects sensible data throughout certification mechanisms (according to Art. 42 GDPR), which is a mandatory requirement for any service which may come in contact with sensitive data. The current paper offers a contribution, showing that the decentralized approach for personal data sharing, may be compliant not only with the requirement of users' centrality but also with GDPR, representing a novelty for IoT-ready personal data sharing management systems based on a distributed environment. This is possible by embedding the consent mechanism described by GDPR, within a real decentralized prototype developed to share personal data and devices. We present our approach and an architectural blueprint which evolves the prototype. © 2019 CCIS.","Blockchain application; GDPR; Personal Data Storage; Privacy Challenges; Profile management; Security and Privacy for Iot",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068445379

Recent innovations in the FinTech sector has disrupted all aspects of finance, ranging from payments, lending, investments to insurance and other service areas. 67% of Indian financial institutions perceive FinTech as a powerful threat to their survival. The FinTech sector has witnessed increased participation from non-financial players such as telecom, power, and other industries. Emerging disruptive trends have proven that a large dataset can be effectively leveraged with total customer engagement and drastically lower investments in IT infrastructure. This paper provides a reflective view of the collective impact of the government digital policies and emerging disruptive technology in India. The paper examines the FinTech disruption formula and its relative implication on the financial services landscape by substituting financial products with IT applications which are cheaper, better and faster. The paper entails the unique case study of ‘India Stack’ aimed at creating a single financial ecosystem in India that is presence-less, paperless and cashless.

Thus, SM can provide a competitive edge for manufacturers that successfully adopt it. In the process of adopting SM, building blocks play a critical role and can be seen as prerequisites. Managers of manufacturing companies are interested in learning what building blocks are relevant and can help make their operations smarter and more competitive. Our paper is a first attempt to answer this question through presenting the most frequently used building blocks for SM adoption. In order to achieve this objective, we conducted a systematic mapping review to identify both building blocks as well as current methods for adopting SM. In a next step, we matched the building blocks with the adoption methods. This matching of building blocks with the adoption methods helped in determining whether a building block actually recommended in the methods for adopting SM. We found that intelligent control, data analytics, IT-based production management systems (e.g., ERP, CAx, etc.), smart products/parts/materials, interoperability, data sharing systems and standards are the most commonly used building blocks for manufacturers that are aligned towards adopting SM. As a consequence, the future manufacturing workforce needs to be prepared to understand analytics, sensors, etc. The results also showed that, although building blocks such as blockchain, robots, visual technology, and 3D printing may find their application in specific manufacturing sectors, overall, they are less commonly associated with SM adoption compared to the other building blocks. © 2019 The Authors.

It is estimated that the systems will be in a state of extreme interaction and reach 50 billion devices connected in Internet in 2020. We know that everything around us will be in interaction and they will do everything without any need of human interference. For example, when our dishwasher is full, it will start to wash automatically, or when the run out of the gasoline, our car will drive to the nearest station, or even when a burglar is entered to our house, it will automatically be detected and be announced to the police office. In business life, the processes will be automatical in maximum level and this technology will increase productivity and efficiency. Next to mobile technology, it is thought that these new generation information systems (IS) will take the biggest place in our lives. AR also will be integrated to these systems to augment the information in real world. Humanity will augment its habitat in an innovative way thanks to these AR based IS. This paper surveys the current state-of-the-art AR systems related with aerospace & defense, industry, education, medical and gaming sectors. The connection of AR based IS and innovation is explained with a technological insight. In addition to international use cases HAVELSAN's use cases are also given that are performed from the aspect of applied open innovation strategy. This strategy is addressed specific to the implemented activities of AR based IS. © 2019 The Authors.
