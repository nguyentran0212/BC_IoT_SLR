One of the major attacking channels is utilizing the firmware of IoT devices as the access interface to compromise the targeted IoT devices. Therefore, it is important for IoT device manufacturers to support secure and efficient firmware update functionality for sold or deployed IoT devices. In this paper, a secure and verifiable blockchain-based firmware update framework for IoT environment is proposed. The aims of the proposed framework are providing secure peer-to-peer verification mechanism on each new version of firmware released by corresponding device manufacturer and providing a reliable way to distribute the updated firmware to IoT devices in timely manner. Furthermore, the utilization of blockchain technology in the proposed framework ensures the integrity of firmware during its distribution through Internet. The proposed firmware update framework consists of four processes: creation of firmware update contract, creation of third-party firmware update contract, PUSH update mechanism and PULL update mechanism. Six corresponding protocols are derived to support the four processes. The evaluation on performance and security strength of the proposed firmware update framework is conducted. Based on the proofs of formal security analysis, the proposed framework supports mutual authentication and defends against major cyber attacks: firmware modification attack, impersonation attack, man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack. ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Blockchain; ECDH; Firmware update; Internet of Things; Smart contract,Yohan:2020:1

Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù for industrial IOT applications. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Blockchain; Ethereum; Industrial IOT; Industry 4.0; Smart contract; Supply chain,Mazzei:2020:1

Due to limited physical size, IoT sensor nodes must have light-weight authentication protocol. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of various technical elements. It is expected that interworking between heterogeneous terminals, networks, and applications. They will accelerate through the liberalization of the IoT platform. As a result, many technical and administrative security threats will arise in the IoT environment. Sensor node protocols must be light-weight and secure. As IoT devices are used for various purposes, for some devices that require performance, the OS with a high-performance chipset that works, most passwords protocol. However, to turn on / off the lights IoT devices that perform simple tasks such as based on a low-performance chipset with no OS running. If it does not support encryption protocol or certificate, then it is vulnerable, and it does not have enough performance to handle.

This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Distributed ledger technologies; Edge computing; Internet of things; Livestock monitoring; Precision agriculture; Smart farming,Alonso:2020:1

Blockchain-based IoT allows service providers to transfer the security and maintenance responsibility to self-maintaining customers. Adopting peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and computing for more than billions of transactions can reduce the costs arising from the installation and maintenance of centralized systems. Small manufacturers providing industrial IoT (IIoT) services can participate more actively in blockchain-based IIoT applications with three-dimensional printing and digital manufacturing technologies, but the measure to maintain privacy on a blockchain is not robust. Here, we propose a P2P networking-based custom manufacturing service, which is an order-driven trading service between a manufacturer and a customer in the blockchain-based IIoT architecture. The proposed system consists of reputation management and service architecture. We propose a new reputation assessment method customized to increase the reliability and accuracy of industrial manufacturing systems. We also propose a manufacturer rating classification to guide the customers‚Äô decision making in a reliable manner and a malicious evaluator identification to exclude feedbacks from malicious evaluators. The proposed service architecture is composed of trustless P2P protocols designed for preserving privacy and providing non-repudiation. We used a cryptographic algorithm for ensuring transaction privacy and the digital signing of blockchain for non-repudiation. We also analyzed the proposed service architecture and the possible attack scenarios to verify the security requirements. We verified that the reputation management system was influenced by each feedback dynamically and guided the customer‚Äôs present decision making with reliable and classified manners, by simulating reputation classification and malicious evaluator identification. Further, we have summarized the originality and the characteristics of the proposed approach by comparing closely related studies and concluded with a future research guide. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Blockchain; Custom manufacturing; Peer to peer networking; Reputation; Trustless,Lee:2020:1

However, malicious nodes located in an IoT network can influence clock synchronization. The security issues of time transfer and consistency are critical and challenging. In this paper, we propose a secure scheme based on blockchain to solve the problem of time synchronization in IoT. In the distributed network of IoT, a blockchain is utilized to record and broadcast time in order to reduce attacks from external environments with the property of passing trust. Moreover, this scheme has the advantage of low-latency by employing a consensus mechanism based on Proof of Stability. Serious analysis and simulation show that the scheme can effectively resist malicious attacks and reduce the latency of consensus process by comparing with traditional methods. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Blockchain; Clock synchronization; Consensus; Internet of Things,Fan:2019:1

The DECENTER's Fog Computing Platform is developed to support Big Data pipelines, which start from the Internet of Things (IoT), such as cameras that provide video-streams for subsequent analysis. It is used to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms across the Edge-Fog-Cloud computing continuum which provide benefits to applications, including high Quality of Service (QoS), improved privacy and security, lower operational costs and similar. In this article, we present a trust management architecture for DECENTER that relies on the use of blockchain-based Smart Contracts (SCs) and specifically designed trustless Smart Oracles. The architecture is implemented on Ethereum ledger (testnet) and three trust management scenarios are used for illustration. The scenarios (trust management for cameras, trusted data flow and QoS based computing node selection) are used to present the benefits of establishing trust relationships among entities, services and stakeholders of the platform. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Blockchain; Fog; Smart contract; Smart oracle; Trust,Kochovski:2019:1

The traditional access control protocols are not suitable for IoT mainly due to a massive scale, ubiquitous connectivity and distributed nature. Blockchain based access control approaches provide decentralized security but they involve scalability problem, high transaction fees, a significant delay, and computational overhead that is not acceptable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, data published on the blockchain are public which is not ideal for many scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a new decentralized access control system based on the Tangle which empowers the users to dictate the access to their resource. In our proposed decentralized access control model the policies and access rights are published on the Tangle which guarantees distributed auditability and prevents the user from fraudulently denying the granted access rights. The main contribution of the paper is to provide privacy of the policy by leveraging Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) data communication protocol. The proposed work is validated by implementation and is tested with AVISPA tool which confirms security in the presence of the intruder. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",ABAC; Access control; Blockchain; Internet of things; IOTA; Tangle,Shafeeq:2019:1

Vulnerabilities in those systems arise from poor physical security, unauthenticated devices, insecure firmware updates, insecure communication, and data corruption. In recent times Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), of which Blockchain is an instance, have been identified as a possible solution to some of these issues. The blokchain model genetically ensures decentralized security and privacy, and therefore could provide IoT systems with a trusted infrastructure for securely logging data or exchanging tokens without the necessity, and costs, of central servers. Blockchain is no panacea, either. IoT devices that get connected to a blockchain network must still be secured, in particular they must protect the confidentiality of the keys. This requires the embedded microcontroller to execute only authenticated firmware, with protections against software attacks, such as buffer overflows, and resistance against side-channel attacks. In addition, as confirmed from the scarcity of implementations reported in the literature, it is still not clear whether blockchain protocols can be implemented efficiently on resource-constrained IoT devices. In this work, also supported by a Demo, we show an example of secure IoT device that enables the functionalities of IOTA, a DLT specifically designed for the use in the IoT. In particular, we present a Light Node based on STM32 that implements all the cryptographic functions, IOTA specific operations and communication functions required to successfully publish transactions in the IOTA distributed ledger. Our implementations on microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M) performs up to 22 times faster in terms of cycles and up to 4 times faster in absolute time with respect to the state-of-The-Art implementation on a Raspberry PI 3B. Our Light Node also ensures protection of the stored private data and guarantees secure firmware update thanks to a suitable configuration of some security features provided by STM32 microcontrollers. ¬© BlockSys 2019 - Proceedings of the 2019 Workshop on Blockchain-Enabled Networked Sensor Systems.

Technology on the other hand is reaching out to meet some of the demands that the healthcare will continuously require in order to deliver their services on time. One such technology is known as the internet of things (IoT). IoT has already proven its great potential towards the healthcare domain. IoT has the ability to allow patients to be monitored from the comfort of their homes through sensors equipped within devices deployed to perform specific tasks. The other technology is none other than the Blockchain which was introduced to deliver its capabilities in the financial ledger. The Blockchain helps to keep track of all the transactions being recorded, which in healthcare sector the need for Blockchain can be transformed to keep a trace of patient records.

The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain.

However, most of these IoT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software update protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism while protects the privacy of involved users. A vendor delivers the updates and makes a commitment by using smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to its IoT devices. A transmission node can get financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. In order to obtain the proof-of-delivery, the transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out fair exchange. Specifically, the transmission node uses the DAPS to exchange an attribute-based signature (ABS) of one IoT device. Then, it uses the ABS as proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, to generate an ABS, the IoT device has to execute complex computations which is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to overcome the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Attribute-based signatures; Blockchain; IoT; Privacy-preserving; Software update,Zhao:2019:1

NeoVM is a turing-complete computing machine, designed for Neo Blockchain, specially designed for cryptographic and deterministic (verifiable) computation. A NeoVM program is called a NVM Script (or just Script), and it is often used together with Neo Blockchain application capabilities, being called a Smart Contract. Smart Contracts are already used on other blockchains such as Bitcoin (although not Turing-complete) for value transfers, through the availability of verifiable information, i.e., transactions and transaction blocks, on a global ledger. However, due to the high processing costs and low throughput capabilities of global public chains, most industrial applications of blockchain require the usage of private/permissioned chains, with the goal of providing high-speed and low-cost information persistance. This work proposes an IoT device prototype capable of delivering blockchain private access to home applications (also called a Smart Home), in a new concept defined as Home Ledger. Applications of Home Ledger include: local permissioned access to sensors and home devices (through state-of-the-art cryptography); guaranteed verification of local stored data (through redundancy and byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanisms); lowcost and high-performance local registry (through usage of lowenergy microcontrollers); auditable cameras and local security on Home Ledger; global availability by interfacing with a global public ledger. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Elliptic Curve Cryptography; Home Ledger; Microcontroller; NEO Blockchain; NeoVM; Smart Home,Da:2019:1

This study proposes applying dark web technology to ensure the privacy of blockchains and servers. The study will monitor packet transmission frequency in intelligent agriculture to prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. The main features of system include: (1) An identity authentication mechanism, (2) secure transmission of information, (3) establishment of private blockchains, (4) a faster, improved authentication system for blockchain information, and (5) resistance against DDOS attacks. The proposed scheme can safeguard network security for the IoT as well as the servers by way of applying dark web technology, which can avoid exposure of blockchains and server ID addresses and thus in turn lower the risks of DDOS attack damages.

Furthermore, distributed edge services can make resource transactions vulnerable to malicious nodes. Ensuring secure edge services under complex industrial networks is a big challenge.

In the literature, existing architectures for permission delegation and access control are either event-based or query-based. These previous works assume a single trusted delegation service, which however is likely biased or fails to service. Also, they fail to allow users to verify delegation service operations, as such cannot be directly applied to IoT (Internet of Things) due to low power, low-bandwidth, ad-hoc and decentralized nature. This paper proposes a novel decentralized architecture for permission delegation and access control for IoT application, with demands on event and query base permission delegation.

One of the uses of IoT is as an environmental monitoring system. In its application, IoT-based environmental monitoring systems are composed of one or more sensors placed in various locations and connected to each other using certain protocols. The problem arises when thousands of IoT devices connected together in one network and using the server-client connection model which raises several works in the synchronization process and access control management. This kind of network depends on a server as the center of control management that work as storing and distributing data from the sensor so that any data comes from the server is considered correct. To overcome this problem, it is proposed an IoT system that uses Blockchain technology which is a distributed data structure that forms blocks that do not require central authority and verification from third parties. From the experiments conducted can be evaluated that blockchain communication is much slower compared to MQTT communication protocol in terms of speed. The data transmission between node is measured with an average delay of 200ms. This system also visualizes data in graph with a high mobility data collection using vehicle so that it can be used to be an alternative of public participatorial measurement. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Air Quality Measurements; Blockchain; Distributed Network; Internet of Things; Vehicle as a Mobile Sensor Network,Yusuf:2019:1

Computing resource trading unavoidably happens in edge-assisted IoT. However, efficient computing resource trading cannot be achieved because of the 'cold start' and 'long return' problems. To address these challenges, we propose to use a credit-based payment for fast computing resource trading in edge-assisted blockchain-enabled IoT; therefore, the IoT nodes can finish fast payment and frequent trading by borrowing resource coins from other IoT nodes based on their credit values. In our resource-coin loan problem, we propose an iterative double-auction-based algorithm, where a broker is introduced to solve the loan allocation problem and to determine the size of the loan each lender would provide to each borrower. Furthermore, the broker enforces specific loan pricing rules to induce the borrowers and lenders to bid truthfully. Then, the hidden privacy information could be extracted to achieve the optimal resource-coin allocation and loan pricing. The proposed algorithm can maximize the economic benefits while protecting privacy. Simulations showed that the proposed algorithm can maximize social welfare. In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with the credit-bank-based method in terms of the satisfaction function and payments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was individually rational, truthful, and budget-balanced. ¬© 2014 IEEE.",Computing resource trading; double auction; edge computing; Internet of Things (IoT); loan,Li:2019:1

The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the examples of smart contract implementations. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",and services; architecture; Blockchain technology (BCT); consensus; cyber-physics system; distributed system; Internet of Things (IoT); smart contract,Viriyasitavat:2019:1

Unfortunately, because of the unique characteristics of resource constraints, short-range communication, and self-organization in IoT, it always resorts to the cloud or fog nodes for outsourced computation and storage, which has brought about a series of novel challenging security and privacy threats. For this reason, one of the critical challenges of having numerous IoT devices is the capacity to manage them and their data. A specific concern is from which devices or Edge clouds to accept join requests or interaction requests. This paper discusses a design concept for developing the IoT data management platform, along with a data management and lineage traceability implementation of the platform based on blockchain and smart contracts, which approaches the two major challenges: how to implement effective data management and enrich rational interoperability for trusted groups of linked Things; And how to settle conflicts between untrusted IoT devices and its requests taking into account security and privacy preserving. Experimental results show that the system scales well with the loss of computing and communication performance maintaining within the acceptable range, works well to effectively defend against unauthorized access and empower data provenance and transparency, which verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the design concept to provide privacy, fine-grained, and integrity data management over the IoT devices by introducing the blockchain-based data management platform. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Blockchain; Data Management; Internet of Things (IoT); Privacy,Cui:2019:1

The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem)in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground)vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs)is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs‚Äô requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network's backbone to transfer EVs‚Äô requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the potential deployment of BEST in energy trading. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",5G; Blockchain; Energy trading; Intelligent transportation system; Smart city; Smart nation; Software-defined networking; Tactile Internet,Chaudhary:2019:1

We use a decentralized storage network for reducing the load on the vendor when distributing patches toward IoT devices, and eliminating central points of failure. Unlike existing peer-to-peer file sharing networks which have a fundamental availability problem for unpopular files, our protocol utilizes blockchain-based smart contracts to incentivize independent peers, termed distributors, by means of cryptocurrency payments. A vendor of IoT devices deploys a smart contract with a deposit, which acts as a publicly verifiable binding bid for delivery of patches to a specific set of IoT endpoints. Distributors will compete for delivering the updates to the desired IoT devices and present proofs-of-distribution in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. We address the fair exchange problem between distributors and the consuming IoT devices by utilizing a variation of the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) protocol, ensuring that the process is trustless. This can encourage the participation of a large number of distributors, and thus facilitate a rapid scale-out of the system.

Just Blockchain Storage Model (JBSM) means every blockchain node in the network stores all of the transaction data that launched in the whole blockchain network, there is no doubt that JBSM consumes a lot of storage resources.

The model consists of three parts: HIoT, Blockchain Network and Cloud Storage Server. This paper analyses how BCSM improves transaction efficiency.

Our threat model accounts for counterfeiting, breakout fraud, and bad mouthing of one entity by others. Entity trust (e.g., IoT devices) depends on quality and level of participation, quality of messages, lifetime of a given entity in the system, and the number of known 'bad' (non-consensus) messages sent by that entity. Based on this approach to trust, we are able to adjust trust upward and downward as a function of real-Time and past behavior, providing other participants with a trust value upon which to judge information from and interactions with the given entity. This approach thereby reduces the potential for manipulation of an IoT system by a bad or byzantine actor. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Blockchain; IoT; RF-DNA Fingerprinting; Trust management,Kandah:2019:1

More specifically, this paper proposes a distributed IoT ledger that is specifically designed for managing the metadata needed for GIDDI. This GIDDI Blockchain is IoT-owned (i.e., it is not controlled by any individual or organization) and is IoT-scaled (i.e., it can support the discovery and reuse of millions of IoT devices). In addition to the GIDDI Blockchain, this paper outlines the design of a GIDDI Marketplace that provides the functionality needed for IoT device registration, query, integration, payment and security via the proposed GIDDI Blockchain. Finally, the paper outlines a prototype GIDDI Blockchain implementation and discusses future research in this area. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",IoT; IoT blockchain; IoT device description; IoT device discovery; IoT device integration,Dawod:2019:1

In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of blockchain-based Secure IoT as a Service (SIoTaaS), where an IoT device can be rented from a service provider, securely and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our framework allows the simultaneous operations of distinct providers of IoT-based sharing economy services at a large scale. Multiple parties can securely share text and multimedia in the context of location and point-of-interest sharing, perform financial transactions by hiding true identity of parties involved in various online transactions, perform user and IoT registration, transfer value transactions via Ethereum tokens between providers and consumers, as well as raw IoT data payload. This can turn smart room IoT devices, such as smart locks, light bulbs, air conditioning and fans into rentable business entities within a secure sharing economy platform. We will demonstrate such a proof of concept IoT sharing economy framework, which is specifically designed to support the temporary IoT needs of very large numbers of users, such as Hajj pilgrims concentrating for a short period of time at a single area in Saudi Arabia. ¬© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Blockchain; IoT as a service; Off-chain; Sharing economy,Rahman:2019:1

Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service. ¬© 2005-2012 IEEE.",Blockchain; Cournot model; Industrial internet of thing (iot); smart contract; Stochastic geometry,Zhu:2019:1

The RFID provides a unique identity of the product and the sensor data, which helps in real time quality monitoring. For this purpose, a small feature size 900-MHz RFID coupled sensor was fabricated and demonstrated for real time sensor data acquisition.

The smart city concepts allows to handle the new challenges and issues created by this growth by applying a wide range of technologies that can provide citizens with a better living environment. Smart agriculture will play an important part of smart cities, as a sustainable and high quality food supply chain is crucial to facilitate the grow of human agglomerates. In this context, European laws imposes very strict requirements in the food industry, in order to ensure that food provenance is always guaranteed. Such fine-grained traceability can be only achieved by applying state-of-the-art technologies. In this paper, we present BRUSCHETTA, a blockchain-based application for the traceability and the certification of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) supply chain. EVOO is an emblematic food product for Italy, but it is also one of the most falsified ones. BRUSCHETTA provides a blockchain-based system to enforce the certification of this product by tracing its entire supply chain: from the plantation to the shops. The goal is to enable the final customer to access a tamper-proof history of the product, including the farming, harvesting, production, packaging, conservation, and transportation processes. BRUSCHETTA leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in order to interconnect sensors dedicated to EVOO quality control, and to let them operate on the blockchain. We also provide a support for the correct tailoring of the BRUSCHETTA blockchain system, and we propose a mechanism for its dynamic auto-tuning to optimize it in case of high loads. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Blockchain; Food supply chain monitoring; Hyperledger Fabric; Performance evaluation; Smart Agricolture; Smart Cities,Arena:2019:1

However, establishing such infrastructure can be exceptionally intricate due to the vast variety of devices and the implemented technologies. Also, it poses several unique challenges, such as heterogeneity of the infrastructure, type, and scale of deployment, security, privacy, and inter-operability. One primary concern in a smart city environment is the capabilities of typically end-IoT devices which are vulnerable to security threats and prone to confidentiality and integrity breach of data. Blockchain can potentially address these security challenges due to the distributed ledger's inherent properties.

However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes. ¬© 2005-2012 IEEE.",Blockchain; Electric vehicles (evs); Proof of reputation (por); Vehicular energy network (ven); Wireless power transfer,Wang:2019:1

How to encourage the willingness to cooperate and share information between these entities has always been one of the major challenges in the field of supply chain management. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can help entities get real-time data in the supply chain to share the key information and reduce costs. However, the supply chain not only needs to know how to gather the data but also ensures that the data processed is not leaked. Since Blockchain, as the main technology of Bitcoin, has the advantages of traceability and anti-counterfeiting, blockchain is the right tool to tackle the date sharing problem in supply chain. In this paper, we connect IIoT devices to the blockchain by combining the monitoring and recording of IIoT devices and storing real-time data in the network by smart contract. In addition, a blockchain-based supply chain structure is proposed. This structure provides collaboration solutions between different entities in the supply chain. In this structure, a fine-grained data sharing scheme for supply chain is proposed. By setting access policies to the smart contract, only the companies that satisfy the attributes of access policies can execute the smart contract and view the details of the transaction.

Misbehaving routers affect the availability of the networks by dropping packets selectively and rejecting data forwarding services. Although existing Reputation Management (RM) systems are useful in identifying misbehaving routers, the centralized nature of the RM center has the risk of one-point failure. The emerging blockchain techniques, with the inherent decentralized consensus mechanism, provide a promising method to reduce this one-point failure risk. By adopting the distributed consensus mechanism, we propose a blockchain-based reputation management system in IoT networks to overcome the limitation of centralized router RM systems. The proposed solution utilizes the blockchain technique as a decentralized database to store router reports for calculating reputation of each router. With the proposed reputation calculation mechanism, the reliability of each router would be evaluated, and the malicious misbehaving routers with low reputations will be blacklisted and get isolated. More importantly, we develop an optimized group mining process for blockchain technique in order to improve the efficiency of block generation and reduce the resource consumption. The simulation results validate the distributed blockchain-based RM system in terms of attacks detection and system convergence performance, and the comparison result of the proposed group mining process with existing blockchain models illustrates the applicability and feasibility of the proposed works. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Blockchain; Distributed reputation management; IoT; Routing protection,Li:2019:1

Recent researches presented in the literature tend to use a Blockchain-based trust management model for IoT besides the fog node approach in order to address the constraints of IoT resources. Actually, Blockchain has solved many drawbacks of centralized models. However, it is still not preferable for dealing with massive data produced by IoT because of its drawbacks such as delay, network overhead, and scalability issues. Therefore, in this paper we define some factors that should be considered when designing scalable models, and we propose a fully distributed trust management model for IoT that provide a large-scale trust model and address the limitations of Blockchain.

Unfortunately, some of these devices are of questionable security, becoming targets of choice for numerous exploits. This can result in compromising the home network, as well as large scale attacks such as the recent Mirai network of botnets that was used in a DDoS attack. The problem is that end users have a hard time assessing the risks induced by connected devices, and often lack the skills and time to administrate their home network. We answer the above challenge by proposing STewARD, a solution that allows users to easily request from their intelligent home network controller the creation of isolated software-defined network slices, to which they assign a required trust level using very simple risk assessment. We build a global trust assessment framework that computes a trust score for each class of devices, based on reported history stored in a blockchain. Network controllers can then leverage this information to connect to slices only those devices that meet the expected trust levels, and can contribute to the crowd-sourced reporting by monitoring the devices' behaviors compared to an expected baseline. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Access Control; Blockchain; Distributed Ledger; Home networking; Internet of Things; Risk management; Security; Software-Defined Networking; Trust,Boussard:2019:1

From the results, we find that our solution provides a high transaction speed and scalability, as well as good performance on security and micropayment which are important in IoT settings.

Improper management of devices and distribution of firmware updates from the device vendor could sabotage the IoT ecosystem. The objective of this proposed scheme is to verify and distribute the firmware binaries securely to the IoT device deployed by the device vendor.

Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial process. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework.

Although they are convenient, they may also be open to attack since physical access may not be needed. In addition, most frameworks use a centralized architecture to update a potentially large number of devices increasing the threat landscape. An alternative solution, that relies on a blockchain framework with smart contracts, is proposed in this paper to protect the integrity of the firmware update process. The proposed system is suitable for use in smart cities or scenarios with a large number of devices and service providers where nodes are authenticated, communications protected, and update conditions specified and enforced through smart contracts. A proof-of- concept system was implemented and tested using an open-source blockchain framework and a WiFi-capabable ESP8266-based board. The system was evaluated for scalability and response to denial of service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Preliminary experimental results show that the approach is feasible and a viable substitute for a centralized solution. ¬© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Blockchain; Firmware update; Internet of Things; Network security,He:2019:1

In this paper, a light-weighted Blockchain-based platform for IIoT is presented to address security, trust, and island connection problem in the process of IIoT ecosystem construction. BPIIoT is comprised of the on-chain network and the off-chain network. All transactions are processed in the on-chain network such as including digital signature based on access control and programmable permission. The off-chain network deals with the storage, complex data processing, and other problems that blockchain cannot solve. The smart contract is utilized as the service contract of consumers and manufacture resources, providing on-demand manufacturing service. Two smart application cases, manufacturing equipment data sharing and maintenance service sharing from smart manufacturing, are implemented to explain the smart contract for equipment maintenance service and status data sharing service throughout maintenance, repair, and operation service network by the BPIIoT. ¬© 2013 IEEE.",Blockchain; IIoT; on-demand; smart contract; Smart manufacturing,Bai:2019:1

Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation. ¬© 2013 IEEE.",blockchain; consensus mechanism; Food traceability; Internet of Things; shelf life management,Tsang:2019:1

Their excessive use makes them vulnerable to be hacked and used for malicious purposes. There are also security loopholes in this technology like the radio waves which can be exploited by the rivals and can cause a large amount of destruction or loss of data. This paper is written to improve the security of UAV and drones by using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a highly secured technology as it uses private key cryptography and peer to peer network. By incorporating this technology in transmitting signals from controller to drone or UAV, we can achieve an extra amount of security in transmitting of signals also it increases the connectivity. ¬© 2019 IEEE.",Aircraft.; Blockchain; Digital Signature; Drone; Hashing; IOT; Security; UAV,Rana:2019:1
